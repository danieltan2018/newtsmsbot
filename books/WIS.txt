1 ACCORDING TO THY GRACIOUS WORD

According to thy gracious word
In meek humility
This will I do, my dying Lord
I will remember thee

Thy body broken for my sake
My bread from heaven shall be
The cup of blessing I will take
And thus remember thee

Gethsemane can I forget?
Or there thy conflict see
Thine agony and bloody sweat
And not remember thee?

When to the cross I turn mine eyes
And rest on Calvary
O Lamb of God, my sacrifice!
I must remember Thee

Remember Thee, and all Thy pains
And all Thy love to me
Yea, while I have a breath, a pulse remains
Will I remember Thee

And when these failing lips grow dumb
And mind and memory flee
When thou shalt in Thy kingdom come
Then, Lord, remember me

3 ALL HAIL THE POWER OF JESUS' NAME

All hail the power of Jesus' name!
Let angels prostrate fall
Bring forth the royal diadem
And crown him Lord of all!

Crown him ye martyrs of your God
Who from his altar call
Extol the stem of Jesse's rod
And crown him Lord of all!

Ye seed of Israel's chosen race
Ye ransomed of the fall
Hail him who saves you by his grace
And crown him Lord of all!

Sinners, whose love can ne'er forget
The wormwood and the gall
Go spread your trophies at his feet
And crown him Lord of all!

Let every kindred, every tribe
On this terrestrial ball
To Him all majesty ascribe
And crown Him Lord of all

Oh that with yonder sacred throng
We at His feet may fall
Join in the everlasting song
And crown Him Lord of all

4 ALL HEAVEN DECLARES

All heaven declares
The glory of the risen Lord
Who can compare
With the beauty of the Lord?
Forever He will be
The Lamb upon the throne
I gladly bow my knee
And worship Him alone

I will proclaim
The glory of the risen Lord
Who once was slain
To reconcile man to God
Forever You will be
The Lamb upon the throne
I gladly bow my knee
And worship You alone


5 ALL I HAVE IS CHRIST

I once was lost in darkest night
Yet thought I knew the way
The sin that promised joy and life
Had led me to the grave
I had no hope that You would own
A rebel to Your will
And if You had not loved me first
I would refuse You still

But as I ran my hell-bound race
Indifferent to the cost
You looked upon my helpless state
And led me to the cross
And I beheld God's love displayed
You suffered in my place
You bore the wrath reserved for me
Now all I know is grace

Hallelujah all I have is Christ
Hallelujah Jesus is my life

Now Lord I would be Yours alone
And live so all might see
The strength to follow Your commands
Could never come from me
O Father use my ransomed life
In any way You choose
And let my song forever be
My only boast is You

6 ALL PRAISE TO HIM

All praise to Him the God of light
Who formed the mountains by His might
All praise to Him Who names the stars
That sing His fame in skies afar
All praise to Him Who reigns in love
Who guides the galaxies above
Yet bends to hear our every prayer
With sovereign pow'r and tender care

All praise to Him Whose love is seen
In Christ the Son the servant King
Who left behind His glorious throne
To pay the ransom for His own
All praise to Him Who humbly came
To bear our sorrow sin and shame
Who lived to die Who died to rise
The all-sufficient sacrifice

All praise to Him whose pow'r imparts
The love of God within our hearts
The Spirit of all truth and peace
The fount of joy and holiness
To Father Son and Spirit now
Our souls we lift our wills we bow
To You the Triune God we raise
With loving hearts our song of praise

7 ALL THE WAY MY SAVIOUR LEADS ME

All the way my saviour leads me
What have I to ask beside?
Can I doubt His tender mercy
Who thro' life has been my guide?

Heav'nly peace, divinest comfort
Here by faith in Him to dwell!
For I know whate'er befall me
Jesus doeth all things well
For I know whate'er befall me
Jesus doeth all things well

All the way my Saviour leads me
Cheers each winding path I tread
Gives me grace for ev'ry trial
Feeds me with the living bread

Though my weary steps may falter
And my soul a-thirst may be
Gushing from the Rock before me
Lo! A spring of joy I see
Gushing from the Rock before me
Lo! A spring of joy I see

All the way my Saviour leads me
Oh, the fullness of His love!
Perfect rest to me is promised
In my Father's house above

When my spirit, clothed immortal
Wings its flight to realms of day
This my song through endless ages
Jesus led me all the way
This my song through endless ages
Jesus led me all the way

8 AMAZING GRACE

Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost
But now am found
Was blind but now I see

'Twas grace that taught
My heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did
That grace appear
The hour I first believed!

Through many dangers
Toils and snares
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought
Me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

When we've been there
Ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days
To sing God's praise
Than when we first begun

9 AND CAN IT BE

And can it be that I should gain
An int'rest in the Saviour's blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?
Amazing love! How can it be
That Thou, my God
Shouldst die for me!

He left His Father's throne above
So free, so infinite His grace!
Emptied Himself of all but love
And bled for Adam's helpless race!
'Tis mercy all, immense and free
For, O my God
It found out me

Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature's night.
Thine eye diffused a quick'ning ray
I woke - the dungeon flamed with light!
My chains fell off, my heart was free
I rose, went forth
And followed Thee

No condemnation now I dread
Jesus and all in Him, is mine!
Alive in Him, my living Head
And clothed in righteousness divine
Bold I approach the eternal throne
And claim the crown
Through Christ my own

10 BE THOU MY VISION

Be Thou my Vision
O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me
Save that Thou art
Thou my best thought
By day or by night
Waking or sleeping
Thy presence my light

Be Thou my Wisdom
Be Thou my true Word
I ever with Thee and
Thou with me, Lord
Thou my great Father
And I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling
And I with Thee one

Be Thou my Shield and
My Sword for the fight
Be Thou my dignity
Be Thou my might
Thou my soul's shelter and
Thou my high tow'r
Raise Thou me heav'nward
O Pow'r of my pow'r

Riches I heed not
Nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance
Now and always
Thou and Thou only
Be first in my heart
High King of heaven
My Treasure Thou art

High King of heaven
When vict'ry is won
May I reach heaven's joys
O bright heav'n's Sun!
Heart of my own heart
Whatever befall
Still be my Vision
O Ruler of all

11 BECAUSE HE LIVES

God sent His Son
They called Him Jesus
He came to love
Heal and forgive
He gave His life to buy my pardon
An empty grave is there to prove
My Saviour lives

Because He lives
I can face tomorrow,
Because He lives
All fear is gone
Because I know, I know He holds the future
And life is worth the living
Just because He lives

How sweet to hold a new born baby
And feel the pride
And joy He gives
But greater still
The calm assurance
This child can face uncertain days
Because Christ lives

And then one day I'll cross the river
I'll fight life's final
War with pain
And then, as death
Gives way to victory
I'll see the lights of glory
And I'll know He lives

12 BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD ABOVE

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
A great High Priest whose name is Love
Who ever lives and pleads for me
My name is graven on His hands
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heav'n He stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart

When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end to all my sin
Because the sinless Saviour died
My sinful soul is counted free
For God the Just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me
To look on Him and pardon me

Behold Him there the risen Lamb
My perfect spotless righteousness
The great unchangeable I Am
The King of glory and of grace
One with Himself I cannot die
My soul is purchased with His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high
With Christ my Saviour and my God
With Christ my Saviour and my God

13 BEHOLD THE LAMB

Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away
Slain for us and we remember
The promise made that all who come in faith
Find forgiveness at the cross
So we share in this Bread of Life
And we drink of His sacrifice
As a sign of our bonds of peace
Around the table of the King

The body of our Saviour Jesus Christ
Torn for you eat and remember
The wounds that heal the death that brings us life
Paid the price to make us one
So we share in this Bread of Life
And we drink of His sacrifice
As a sign of our bonds of love
Around the table of the King

The blood that cleanses every stain of sin
Shed for you drink and remember
He drained death's cup that all may enter in
To receive the life of God
So we share in this Bread of Life
And we drink of His sacrifice
As a sign of our bonds of grace
Around the table of the King

And so with thankfulness and faith we rise
To respond and to remember
Our call to follow in the steps of Christ
As His body here on earth
As we share in His suffering
We proclaim Christ will come again
And we'll join in the feast of heaven
Around the table of the King

14 BENEATH THE CROSS OF JESUS

Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand
The shadow of a mighty rock
Within a weary land
A home within the wilderness
A rest upon the way
From the burning of the noontide heat
And the burden of the day

There lies beneath its shadow
But on the farther side
The darkness of an awful grave
That gapes both deep and wide
And there between us stands the cross
Two arms outstretched to save
Like a watchman set to guard the way
From that eternal grave

Upon the cross of Jesus
Mine eyes at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me
And from my smitten heart with tears
Two wonders I confess
The wonder of redeeming love
And my unworthiness

I take O cross thy shadow
For my abiding place
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face
Content to let the world go by
To know no gain nor loss
My sinful self my only shame
My glory all the cross

O safe and happy shelter
O refuge tried and sweet
O trysting place where heaven's love
And heaven's justice meet
As to the holy patriarch
That wondrous dream was giv'n
So seems my Saviour's cross to me
A ladder up to heav'n

15 BY FAITH

By faith we see the hand of God
In the light of creation's grand design
In the lives of those who prove His faithfulness
Who walk by faith and not by sight

By faith our fathers roamed the earth
With the pow'r of His promise in their hearts
Of a holy city built by God's own hand
A place where peace and justice reign

We will stand as children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward
Till the race is finished and the work is done
We'll walk by faith and not by sight

By faith the prophets saw a day
When the longed-for Messiah would appear
With the pow'r to break the chains of sin and death
And rise triumphant from the grave

By faith the church was called to go
In the pow'r of the Spirit to the lost
To deliver captives and to preach good news
In ev'ry corner of the earth

By faith the mountain shall be moved
And the pow'r of the gospel shall prevail
For we know in Christ all things are possible
For all who call upon His name

16 COME BEHOLD THE WONDROUS MYSTERY

Come behold the wondrous myst'ry
In the dawning of the King
He the theme of heaven's praises
Robed in frail humanity
In our longing in our darkness
Now the light of life has come
Look to Christ who condescended
Took on flesh to ransom us

Come behold the wondrous myst'ry
He the perfect Son of Man
In His living in His suff'ring
Never trace nor stain of sin
See the true and better Adam
Come to save the hell-bound man
Christ the great and sure fulfillment
Of the law in Him we stand

Come behold the wondrous myst'ry
Christ the Lord upon the tree
In the stead of ruined sinners
Hangs the Lamb in victory
See the price of our redemption
See the Father's plan unfold
Bringing many sons to glory
Grace unmeasured love untold

Come behold the wondrous myst'ry
Slain by death the God of life
But no grave could e'er restrain Him
Praise the Lord He is alive
What a foretaste of deliv'rance
How unwavering our hope
Christ in power resurrected
As we will be when He comes

17 COME PEOPLE OF THE RISEN KING

Come people of the Risen King
Who delight to bring Him praise
Come all and tune your hearts to sing
To the Morning Star of grace
From the shifting shadows of the earth
We will lift our eyes to Him
Where steady arms of mercy reach
To gather children in

Rejoice rejoice let ev'ry tongue rejoice
One heart one voice
O Church of Christ rejoice

Come those whose joy is morning sun
And those weeping through the night
Come those who tell of battles won
And those struggling in the fight
For His perfect love will never change
And His mercies never cease
But follow us through all our days
With the certain hope of peace

Come young and old from ev'ry land
Men and women of the faith
Come those with full or empty hands
Find the riches of His grace
Over all the world His people sing
Shore to shore we hear them call
The truth that cries through ev'ry age
Our God is all in all

18 COME TO THE TABLE

Come to the table of mercy
Prepared with the wine and the bread
All who are hungry and thirsty
Come and your souls will be fed

Come at the Lord's invitation
Receive from His nail-scarred hand
Eat of the bread of salvation
Drink of the blood of the Lamb

19 COME THOU FOUNT OF EVERY BLESSING

Come Thou fount of ev'ry blessing
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
Mount of Thy redeeming love

Here I raise mine Ebenezer
Hither by Thy help I'm come
And I hope by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wand'ring from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be
Let Thy grace Lord like a fetter
Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee
Prone to wander Lord I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Here's my heart Lord take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above

20 CROWN HIM WITH MANY CROWNS

Crown Him with many crowns
The Lamb upon His throne
Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own
Awake my soul and sing
Of Him who died for thee
And hail Him as thy matchless King
Through all eternity

Crown Him the Lord of life
Who triumphed o'er the grave
And rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save
His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die

Crown Him the Lord of love
Behold His hands and side
Rich wounds yet visible above
In beauty glorified
No angel in the sky
Can fully bear that sight
But downward bends each burning eye
At mysteries so bright

Crown Him the Lord of peace
Whose power a sceptre sways
From pole to pole That wars may cease
And all be prayer and praise
His reign shall know no end
And round His pierced feet
Fair flowers of paradise extend
Their fragrance ever sweet

Crown Him the Lord of years
The Potentate of time
Creator of the rolling spheres
Ineffably sublime
All hail Redeemer hail
For Thou hast died for me
Thy praise shall never never fail
Throughout eternity

21 EVERY PROMISE

From the breaking of the dawn
To the setting of the sun
I will stand on ev'ry promise of Your word
Words of power strong to save
That will never pass away
I will stand on ev'ry promise of Your word
For Your covenant is sure
And on this I am secure
I can stand on ev'ry promise from Your word

When I stumble and I sin
Condemnation pressing in
I will stand on ev'ry promise of Your word
You are faithful to forgive
That in freedom I might live
So I stand on ev'ry promise of Your word
Guilt to innocence restored
You remember sins no more
So I'll stand on ev'ry promise of Your word

When I'm faced with anguished choice
I will listen for Your voice
And I'll stand on ev'ry promise of Your word
Through this dark and troubled land
You will guide me with Your hand
As I stand on ev'ry promise of Your word
And You've promised to complete
Ev'ry work begun in me
So I'll stand on ev'ry promise of Your word

Hope that lifts me from despair
Love that casts out ev'ry fear
As I stand on ev'ry promise of Your word
Not forsaken not alone
For the Comforter has come
And I stand on ev'ry promise of Your word
Grace sufficient grace for me
Grace for all who will believe
We will stand on ev'ry promise of Your word

22 FACING A TASK UNFINISHED (WE GO TO ALL THE WORLD)

Facing a task unfinished
That drives us to our knees
A need that undiminished
Rebukes our slothful ease
We who rejoice to know Thee
Renew before Thy throne
The solemn pledge we owe Thee
To go and make Thee known

Where other lords beside Thee
Hold their unhindered sway
Where forces that defied Thee
Defy Thee still today
With none to heed their crying
For life and love and light
Unnumbered souls are dying
And pass into the night

We go to all the world
With (His) kingdom hope unfurled
No other name has power to save
But Jesus Christ The Lord

We bear the torch that flaming
Fell from the hands of those
Who gave their lives proclaiming
That Jesus died and rose
Ours is the same commission
The same glad message ours
Fired by the same ambition
To Thee we yield our powers

O Father who sustained them
O Spirit who inspired
Saviour whose love constrained them
To toil with zeal untired
From cowardice defend us
From lethargy awake
Forth on Thine errands send us
To labour for Thy sake

23 GLORIOUS DAY (LIVING HE LOVED ME)

One day when heaven was filled with His praises
One day when sin was as black as could be
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin
Dwelt among men my example is He
The Word became flesh
And the light shined among us
His glory revealed

Living He loved me dying He saved me
Buried He carried my sins far away
Rising He justified freely forever
One day He's coming
O glorious day (glorious day)

One day they led Him up Calv'ry's mountain
One day they nailed Him to die on a tree
Suffering anguish despised and rejected
Bearing our sins my Redeemer is He
The hand that healed nations
Stretched out on a tree
And took the nails for me

One day the grave could conceal Him no longer
One day the stone rolled away from the door
Then He arose over death He had conquered
Now is ascended my Lord evermore
Death could not hold Him
The grave could not keep Him
From rising again

One day the trumpet will sound for His coming
One day the skies with His glories will shine
Wonderful day my beloved one bringing
My Saviour Jesus is mine

O glorious day glorious day
O glorious day

24 GLORIOUS THINGS OF THEE ARE SPOKEN

Glorious things of thee are spoken
Zion, city of our God!
He, Whose Word cannot be broken
Formed thee for His own abode
On the Rock of Ages founded
What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation's walls surrounded
Thou mayst smile at all thy foes

See the streams of living waters
Springing from eternal love
Well supply thy sons and daughters
And all fear of want remove
Who can faint while such a river
Ever flows, their thirst to assuage?
Grace which, like the Lord the Giver
Never fails from age to age

Round each habitation hovering
See the cloud and fire appear!
For a glory and a covering
Showing that the Lord is near
Glorious things of thee are spoken
Zion, city of our God
He whose word cannot be broken
Form thee for His own abode

25 GREAT GOD OF WONDERS

Great God of wonders, all Thy ways
Are worthy of Thyself-divine!
But the fair glories of Thy grace
Beyond Thine other wonders shine

Who is a pardoning God like Thee,
Or who has grace so rich and free?

Angels and men, resign your claim
To pity, mercy, love, and grace
These glories crown Jehovah's name
With an incomparable blaze

Crimes of such horror to forgive!
Such guilty, daring worms to spare
This is Thy grand prerogative
And in the honour none shall share

In wonder lost, with trembling joy
We take the pardon of our God
Pardon for sins of deepest dye
A pardon bought with Jesu's blood

Oh may this strange, this matchless grace
This God-like miracle of love
Fill the wide earth with grateful praise
And all the angelic choirs above

26 GREAT IS THE LORD

Great is the Lord
And most worthy of praise
In the city of our God the holy place
The joy of the whole earth
Great is the Lord
In whom we have the victory
He aids us against the enemy
We bow down on our knees

And Lord we want to lift
Your name on high
And Lord we want to thank You
For the works You've done in our lives
And Lord we trust in Your unfailing love
For You alone are God eternal
Throughout earth and heaven above

27 GREAT IS THY FAITHFULNESS

Great is Thy faithfulness
Great is Thy faithfulness
Morning by morning
New mercies I see
All I have needed
Thy hand hath provided
Great is Thy faithfulness
Lord unto me

Great is Thy faithfulness
O God my Father
There is no shadow
Of turning with Thee
Thou changest not
Thy compassions they fail not
As Thou hast been
Thou forever wilt be

Summer and winter
And springtime and harvest
Sun moon and stars
In their courses above
Join with all nature
In manifold witness
To Thy great faithfulness
Mercy and love

Pardon for sin
And a peace that endureth
Thy own dear presence
To cheer and to guide
Strength for today
And bright hope for tomorrow
Blessings all mine
With ten thousand beside

28 HE IS EXALTED

He is exalted
The King is exalted on high
I will praise Him
He is exalted forever exalted
And I will praise His name

He is the Lord
Forever His truth shall reign
Heaven and earth
Rejoice in His holy name
He is exalted
The King is exalted on high

29 HE WILL HOLD ME FAST

When I fear my faith will fail
Christ will hold me fast
When the tempter would prevail
He will hold me fast
I could never keep my hold
Through life's fearful path
For my love is often cold
He must hold me fast

He will hold me fast
He will hold me fast
For my Saviour loves me so
He will hold me fast

Those He saves are His delight
Christ will hold me fast
Precious in His holy sight
He will hold me fast
He'll not let my soul be lost
His Promises shall last
Bought by Him at such a cost
He will hold me fast

For my life He bled and died
Christ will hold me fast
Justice has been satisfied
He will hold me fast
Raised with Him to endless life
He will hold me fast
Till our faith is turned to sight
When He comes at last

30 HERE IS LOVE

Here is love vast as the ocean
Loving kindness as the flood
When the Prince of life our ransom
Shed for us His precious blood
Who His love will not remember
Who can cease to sing His praise
He will never be forgotten
Throughout heav'n's eternal days

On the mount of crucifixion
Fountains opened deep and wide
Through the floodgates of God's mercy
Flowed a vast and gracious tide
Grace and love like mighty rivers
Poured incessant from above
Heaven's peace and perfect justice
Kissed a guilty world in love

31 HERE, O MY LORD

Here, O my Lord
I see thee face to face
Here would I touch and
Handle things unseen
Here grasp with firmer
Hand the eternal grace
And all my weariness
Upon thee lean

Here would I feed
Upon the Bread of God,
Here drink with thee
The royal Wine of heaven;
Here would I lay aside
Each earthly load
Here taste afresh the calm
Of sin forgiven

Mine is the sin, but thine
The righteousness
Mine is the guilt, but
Thine the cleansing blood;
Here is my robe
My refuge, and my peace
Thy Blood, thy righteousness,
O Lord my God!

I have no help but thine
Nor do I need
Another arm save
Thine to lean upon;
It is enough, my Lord,
Enough indeed
My strength is in thy might
Thy might alone

Too soon we rise
The symbols disappear
The feast, though not the
Love is past and gone
The bread and wine remove
But Thou art here
Nearer than ever
Still my shield and sun

Feast after feast
Thus comes and passes by
Yet, passing, points to
The glad feast above
Giving sweet foretaste
Of the festal joy
The Lamb's great bridal feast
Of bliss and love

32 HIS MERCY IS MORE

What love could remember no wrongs we have done
Omniscient all knowing He counts not their sum
Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore
Our sins they are many His mercy is more

What patience would wait as we constantly roam
What Father so tender is calling us home
He welcomes the weakest the vilest the poor
Our sins they are many His mercy is more

What riches of kindness He lavished on us
His blood was the payment His life was the cost
We stood 'neath a debt we could never afford
Our sins they are many His mercy is more

Praise the Lord His mercy is more
Stronger than darkness new every morn
Our sins they are many His mercy is more

33 HOLY HOLY HOLY

Holy holy holy
Lord God Almighty
Early in the morning
Our song shall rise to Thee
Holy holy holy
Merciful and mighty
God in three persons
Blessed Trinity

Holy holy holy
All the saints adore Thee
Casting down their golden crowns
Around the glassy sea
Cherubim and seraphim
Falling down before Thee
Which wert and art
And evermore shalt be

Holy holy holy
Though the darkness hide Thee
Though the eye of sinful man
Thy glory may not see
Only Thou art holy
There is none beside Thee
Perfect in power
In love and purity

Holy holy holy
Lord God Almighty
All Thy works shall praise Thy name
In earth and sky and sea
Holy holy holy
Merciful and mighty
God in three persons
Blessed Trinity

34 HOLY SPIRIT

Holy Spirit living Breath of God
Breathe new life into my willing soul
Let the presence of the risen Lord
Come renew my heart and make me whole
Cause Your word to come alive in me
Give me faith for what I cannot see
Give me passion for Your purity
Holy Spirit breathe new life in me

Holy Spirit come abide within
May Your joy be seen in all I do
Love enough to cover ev'ry sin
In each thought and deed and attitude
Kindness to the greatest and the least
Gentleness that sows the path of peace
Turn my strivings into works of grace
Breath of God show Christ in all I do

Holy Spirit from creation's birth
Giving life to all that God has made
Show Your power once again on earth
Cause Your church to hunger for Your ways
Let the fragrance of our pray'rs arise
Lead us on the road of sacrifice
That in unity the face of Christ
May be clear for all the world to see

35 HOW DEEP THE FATHER'S LOVE FOR US

How deep the Father's love for us
How vast beyond all measure
That He should give His only Son
To make a wretch His treasure
How great the pain of searing loss
The Father turns His face away
As wounds which mar the Chosen One
Bring many sons to glory

Behold the Man upon a cross
My sin upon His shoulders
Ashamed I hear my mocking voice
Call out among the scoffers
It was my sin that held Him there
Until it was accomplished
His dying breath has brought me life
I know that it is finished

I will not boast in anything
No gifts no pow’r no wisdom
But I will boast in Jesus Christ
His death and resurrection
Why should I gain from His reward
I cannot give an answer
But this I know with all my heart
His wounds have paid my ransom

36 HOW GREAT IS YOUR FAITHFULNESS

The heavens ring
The saints all sing
Great is Your faithfulness
From age to age we will proclaim
Great is Your faithfulness
(How great is Your faithfulness)

Now unto the King who reigns over all
And never changes or turns
Unfailing justice unfading grace
Whose promises remain
Yes Your promises remain

Ev'rything changes but You stay the same
Your Word and kingdom endure
We lean on the promise of all that You are
And trust forevermore
We will trust forevermore

From generation to generation
You never failed us O God
Yesterday and today and tomorrow
Until the day You return

How great is Your faithfulness

37 HOW GREAT THOU ART

O Lord my God when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the works Thy hand hath made
I see the stars I hear the mighty thunder
Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed

Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art how great Thou art
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art how great Thou art

When through the woods and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze

And when I think that God His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die I scarce can take it in
That on the Cross my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home what joy shall fill my heart
Then shall I bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim my God how great Thou art

38 I CANNOT TELL

I cannot tell why He whom angels worship
Should set His love upon the sons of men
Or why as Shepherd He should seek the wanderers
To bring them back they know not how or when
But this I know that He was born of Mary
When Bethlehem's manger was His only home
And that He lived at Nazareth and laboured
And so the Saviour Saviour of the world is come

I cannot tell how silently He suffered
As with His peace He graced this place of tears
Or how His heart upon the cross was broken
The crown of pain to three and thirty years
But this I know He heals the broken-hearted
And stays our sin and calms our lurking fear
And lifts the burden from the heavy-laden
For yet the Saviour Saviour of the world is here

I cannot tell how He will win the nations
How He will claim His earthly heritage
How satisfy the needs and aspirations
Of east and west of sinner and of sage
But this I know all flesh shall see His glory
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown
And some glad day His sun shall shine in splendour
When He the Saviour Saviour of the world is known

I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship
When at His bidding every storm is stilled
Or who can say how great the jubilation
When all the hearts of men with love are filled
But this I know the skies will thrill with rapture
And myriad myriad human voices sing
And earth to heaven and heaven to earth will answer
At last the Saviour Saviour of the world is King

39 I KNOW WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED

I know not why God's wondrous grace
To me He hath made known
Nor why unworthy Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own

But I know whom I have believed
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day

I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart
Nor how believing in His word
Wrought peace within my heart

I know not how the Spirit moves
Convincing men of sin
Revealing Jesus through the Word
Creating faith in Him

I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me
Of weary ways or golden days
Before His face I see

I know not when my Lord may come
At night or noonday fair
Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him
Or meet Him in the air

40 I STAND IN AWE

You are beautiful beyond description
Too marvelous for words
Too wonderful for comprehension
Like nothing ever seen or heard
Who can grasp Your infinite wisdom
Who can fathom the depth of Your love
You are beautiful beyond description
Majesty enthroned above

And I stand I stand in awe of You
I stand I stand in awe of You
Holy God to whom all praise is due
I stand in awe of You

You are beautiful beyond description
Yet God crushed You for my sin
In agony and deep affliction
Cut off that I might enter in
Who can grasp such tender compassion
Who can fathom this mercy so free
You are beautiful beyond description
Lamb of God who died for me

41 IMMORTAL INVISIBLE GOD ONLY WISE

Immortal, invisible
God only wise
In light inaccessible
Hid from our eyes
Most blessed, most glorious
The Ancient of Days
Almighty, victorious
Thy great name we praise

Unresting, unhasting
And silent as light
Nor wanting, nor wasting
Thou rulest in might
Thy justice like mountains
High soaring above
Thy clouds, which are fountains
Of goodness and love

To all, life Thou givest
To both great and small
In all life Thou livest
The true life of all
We blossom and flourish
As leaves on the tree
And wither and perish
But nought changeth Thee

Great Father of glory
Pure Father of light
Thine angels adore Thee
All veiling their sight
But of all Thy rich graces
This grace, Lord, impart
Take the veil from our faces
The veil from our heart

All laud we would render
Oh help us to see
'Tis only the splendour
Of light hideth Thee
And so let Thy glory
Almighty, impart
Through Christ in the story
Thy Christ to the heart

42 IN CHRIST ALONE

In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light my strength my song
This Cornerstone this solid Ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm
What heights of love what depths of peace
When fears are stilled when strivings cease
My Comforter my All in All
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe
This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones He came to save
Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave He rose again
And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny
No power of hell no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand
Till He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

43 IT IS WELL WITH MY SOUL

When peace like a river
Attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot
Thou hast taught me to say
It is well
It is well with my soul

It is well with my soul
It is well
It is well with my soul

Tho' Satan should buffet
Tho' trials should come
Let this blest assurance control
That Christ hath regarded
My helpless estate
And hath shed His own blood
For my soul

My sin O the bliss
Of this glorious tho't
My sin not in part but the whole
Is nailed to the cross
And I bear it no more
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord O my soul

And Lord haste the day
When the faith shall be sight
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
The trump shall resound
And the Lord shall descend
Even so it is well
With my soul

44 JESUS IS LORD

Jesus is Lord
The cry that echoes through creation
Resplendent pow'r eternal Word our Rock
The Son of God
The King whose glory fills the heavens
Yet bids us come to taste this living bread

Jesus is Lord
Whose voice sustains the stars and planets
Yet in His wisdom laid aside His crown
Jesus the man
Who washed our feet who bore our suffering
Became a curse to bring salvation's plan

Jesus is Lord
The tomb is gloriously empty
Not even death could crush this King of love
The price is paid
The chains are loosed and we're forgiven
And we can run into the arms of God

Jesus is Lord
A shout of joy a cry of anguish
As He returns and every knee bows low
Then every eye
And every heart will see His glory
The judge of all will take His children home

45 JESUS OUR LORD, WITH WHAT JOY WE ADORE THEE (LORD, THOU ART WORTHY)

Jesus our Lord, with what joy we adore Thee,
Chanting our praise to Thyself on the throne!
Blest in Thy presence, we worship before Thee,
Own Thou art worthy, and worthy alone

Lord, Thou art worthy; Lord, Thou art worthy;
Lord, Thou art worthy and worthy alone!
Blest in Thy presence, we worship before Thee
Own Thou art worthy, and worthy alone.

Verily God, yet become truly human
Lower than angels-to die in our stead;
How hast Thou, long promised "seed of the woman,"
Trod on the serpent, and bruised his head!

How didst Thou humble Thyself to be taken,
Led by Thy creatures, and nailed to the cross!
Hated of men, and of God, too, forsaken,
Shunning not darkness, the curse, and the loss!

How hast Thou triumphed, and triumphed with glory,
Battled death's forces, rolled back every wave!
Carl we refrain, then, from telling the story?
Lord, Thou art victor o'er death and the grave!

46 JESUS PAID IT ALL

I hear the Saviour say
Thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all

Jesus paid it all
All to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

Lord now indeed I find
Thy power and Thine alone
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone

For nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calvary's Lamb

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete
Jesus died my soul to save
My lips shall still repeat

47 JESUS SHALL REIGN

Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
Does His successive journeys run
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore
Till moons shall rise and set no more

To Him shall endless prayer be made
And princes throng to crown His head
His name like sweet perfume shall rise
With every morning sacrifice

Let every creature rise and bring
The highest honours to our King
Angels descend with songs again
And earth repeats the loud Amen

48 JESUS SHALL TAKE THE HIGHEST HONOUR

Jesus shall take the highest honour
Jesus shall take the highest praise
Let all earth join heav'n in exalting
The Name which is above all other names
Let's bow the knee in humble adoration
For at His Name ev'ry knee must bow
Let every tongue confess
He is Christ God's only Son
Sov'reign Lord we give You glory now

For all honour
And blessing and power
Belongs to You belongs to You
All honour and blessing and power
Belongs to You belongs to You
Lord Jesus Christ
Son of the living God

49 KING OF MY LIFE I CROWN THEE NOW (LEST I FORGET)

King of my life I crown Thee now
Thine shall the glory be
Lest I forget Thy thorn crowned brow
Lead me to Calvary

Lest I forget Gethsemane
Lest I forget Thine agony
Lest I forget Thy love for me
Lead me to Calvary

Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid
Tenderly mourned and wept
Angels in robes of light arrayed
Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept

Let me like Mary through the gloom
Come with a gift to Thee
Show to me now the empty tomb
Lead me to Calvary

May I be willing Lord to bear
Daily my cross for Thee
Even Thy cup of grief to share
Thou hast borne all for me

Fill me, O Lord, with Thy desire
For all who know not Thee
Then touch my lips with holy fire
To speak of Calvary

50 LAMB OF GOD! OUR SOULS ADORE THEE

Lamb of God! Our souls adore Thee
While upon Thy face we gaze
There the Father's love and glory
Shine in all their brightest rays
Thine almighty power and wisdom
All creation's works proclaim
Heaven and earth alike confess Thee
As the ever great "I AM."

Lamb of God! Thy Father's bosom
Ever was Thy dwelling place
His delight, in Him rejoicing
One with Him in power and grace
Oh, that wondrous love and mercy--
Thou didst lay Thy glory by
And for us didst come from Heaven
As the Lamb of God, to die!

Lamb of God! When we behold Thee
Lowly in the manger laid
Wandering as a homeless stranger
In the world Thy hands had made
When we see Thee in the garden
In Thine agony of blood
At Thy grace we are confounded
Holy, spotless, Lamb of God!

When we see Thee, as the Victim
Bound for us upon the tree
For our guilt and folly stricken
All our judgment born by Thee--
Lord, we own, with hearts adoring
Thou hast loved us unto blood
Glory, glory everlasting
Be to Thee, Thou Lamb of God!

51 LORD OF THE CHURCH WE PRAY FOR OUR RENEWING

Lord of the church we pray for our renewing
Christ over all our undivided aim
Fire of the Spirit burn for our enduing
Wind of the Spirit fan the living flame
We turn to Christ amid our fear and failing
The will that lacks the courage to be free
The weary labours all but unavailing
To bring us nearer what a church should be

Lord of the church we seek a Father's blessing
A true repentance and a faith restored
A swift obedience and a new possessing
Filled with the Holy Spirit of the Lord
We turn to Christ from all our restless striving
Unnumbered voices with a single prayer
The living water for our souls' reviving
In Christ to live and love and serve and care

Lord of the church we long for our uniting
True to one calling by one vision stirred
One cross proclaiming and one creed reciting
One in the truth of Jesus and His word
So lead us on till toil and trouble ended
One church triumphant one new song shall sing
To praise His glory risen and ascended
Christ over all the everlasting King

52 LORD I LIFT YOUR NAME ON HIGH

Lord I lift Your name on high
Lord I love to sing Your praises
I'm so glad You're in my life
I'm so glad You came to save us

You came from heaven to earth
To show the way
From the earth to the cross
My debt to pay
From the cross to the grave
From the grave to the sky
Lord I lift Your name on high

53 LOVE DIVINE, ALL LOVES EXCELLING

Love divine all loves excelling
Joy of heav'n to earth come down
Fix in us Thy humble dwelling
All Thy faithful mercies crown
Jesus Thou art all compassion
Pure unbounded love Thou art
Visit us with Thy salvation
Enter every trembling heart

Breathe O breathe Thy loving Spirit
Into every troubled breast
Let us all in Thee inherit
Let us find the promised rest
Take away our bent to sinning
Alpha and Omega be
End of faith as its beginning
Set our hearts at liberty

Come Almighty to deliver
Let us all Thy life receive
Suddenly return and never
Nevermore Thy temples leave
Thee we would be always blessing
Serve Thee as Thy hosts above
Pray and praise Thee without ceasing
Glory in Thy perfect love

Finish then Thy new creation
Pure and spotless let us be
Let us see Thy great salvation
Perfectly restored in Thee
Changed from glory into glory
Till in heav'n we take our place
Till we cast our crowns before Thee
Lost in wonder love and praise

54 MAJESTY

Majesty, worship His majesty
Unto Jesus be all glory
Honor and praise

Majesty, kingdom authority
Flow from His throne
Unto His own His anthem raise

So exalt, lift up on high
The name of Jesus
Magnify, come glorify
Christ Jesus the King

Majesty, worship His majesty
Jesus who died, now glorified
King of all kings

55 MAN OF SORROWS! WHAT A NAME

Man of Sorrows! what a name
For the Son of God, Who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!

Bearing shame and scoffing rude
In my place condemned He stood
Sealed my pardon with His blood
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!

Guilty, vile, and helpless we
Spotless Lamb of God was He
“Full atonement!” can it be?
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!

Lifted up was He to die
“It is finished!” was His cry
Now in Heav’n exalted high
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!

When He comes, our glorious King
All His ransomed home to bring
Then anew His song we’ll sing
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!

56 MAY THE MIND OF CHRIST MY SAVIOUR

May the mind of Christ my Saviour
Live in me from day to day
By His love and pow’r controlling
All I do and say

May the word of God dwell richly
In my heart from hour to hour
So that all may see I triumph
Only through His pow’r

May the peace of God my Father
Rule my life in ev’rything
That I may be calm to comfort
Sick and sorrowing

May the love of Jesus fill me
As the waters fill the sea
Him exalting self abasing
This is victory

May I run the race before me
Strong and brave to face the foe
Looking only unto Jesus
As I onward go

May His beauty rest upon me
As I seek the lost to win
And may they forget the channel
Seeing only Him

57 MAY THE PEOPLES PRAISE YOU

You have called us out of darkest night
Into Your glorious light
That we may sing the wonders of
The risen Christ

May our every breath retell the grace
That broke into our strife
With boundless love and deepest joy
With endless life

May the peoples praise You
Let the nations be glad
All Your blessing comes
That we may praise
May praise the Name of Jesus

All the earth is Yours and all within
Each harvest is Your own
And from Your hand we give to You
To make Christ known

May the seeds of mercy grow in us
For those who have not heard
May songs of praise build lives of grace
To spread Your Word

This our holy priv'lege to declare
Your praises and Your name
To every nation tribe and tongue
Your church proclaim

Holy Holy is the Lord Almighty
Worthy worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Holy Holy is the Lord Almighty
All creation praise Your glorious Name

58 MY HOPE IS BUILT ON NOTHING LESS

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name

On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In ev'ry high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

His oath His covenant His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

When He shall come with trumpet sound
O may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

59 MY SONG IS LOVE UNKNOWN

My song is love unknown
My Saviour's love to me
Love to the loveless shown
That they might lovely be
O who am I
That for my sake
My Lord should take
Frail flesh and die

He came from His blest throne
Salvation to bestow
But men made strange and none
The longed-for Christ would know
But O my Friend
My Friend indeed
Who at my need
His life did spend

Sometimes they strew His way
And His sweet praises sing
Resounding all the day
Hosannas to their King
Then Crucify
Is all their breath
And for His death
They thirst and cry

They rise and needs will have
My dear Lord made away
A murderer they save
The Prince of Life they slay
Yet cheerful He
To suffering goes
That He His foes
From thence might free

In life no house no home
My Lord on earth might have
In death no friendly tomb
But what a stranger gave
What may I say
Heaven was His home
But mine the tomb
Wherein He lay

Here might I stay and sing
No story so divine
Never was love dear King
Never was grief like Thine
This is my Friend
In whose sweet praise
I all my days
Could gladly spend

60 MY WORTH IS NOT IN WHAT I OWN (AT THE CROSS)

My worth is not in what I own
Not in the strength of flesh and bone
But in the costly wounds of love at the cross

My worth is not in skill or name
In win or lose in pride or shame
But in the blood of Christ that flowed at the cross

I rejoice in my Redeemer
Greatest treasure Wellspring of my soul
I will trust in Him no other
My soul is satisfied in Him alone

As summer flowers we fade and die
Fame youth and beauty hurry by
But life eternal calls to us at the cross

I will not boast in wealth or might
Or human wisdom's fleeting light
But I will boast in knowing Christ at the cross

Two wonders here that I confess
My worth and my unworthiness
My value fixed my ransom paid at the cross

61 NO OTHER NAME

There is no other name
In heaven can be found
Through whom we are redeemed
Through whom Your grace abounds
No other name can save
But Jesus Christ our Lord

My joy in sorrow's tears
My strength to cast out fears
No other name
But Jesus Jesus
My hope in darkest night
My broken soul's delight
No other name
But Jesus Jesus

There is no victory
But Jesus crucified
No other cure for sin
But that our Saviour died
No other hope we have
But that He rose again
He rose again

No other throne endures
No other song remains
But worthy is the Lamb
Who was for sinners slain
When every knee shall bow
And tongue confess You are Lord
You are Lord

62 NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD

What can wash away my sin
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

O precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

For my pardon this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
For my cleansing this my plea
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Nothing can for sin atone
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Naught of good that I have done
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

63 NOTHING CAN I BOAST IN

At God's perfect timing
Christ died for fallen man
He wore a crown of thorns
Nails driven through His hands
Christ willingly endured it
To death He chose to go
He broke His body for us
Shed blood to make us whole

Nothing can I boast in
My life is scarred with sin
My works are filthy rags
No merit can I bring
Yet mercy filled Christ's heart
Love took Him to the tree
It's grace alone which saves me
Christ's blood that sets me free

So if I am boasting
I'll speak of my disgrace
For my weak self displays
The power of God's grace
Christ's Spirit works within me
In weakness He is strong
So I look to my Saviour
To safely bring me home

64 O CHURCH ARISE

O church arise and put your armour on
Hear the call of Christ our Captain
For now the weak can say that they are strong
In the strength that God has given
With shield of faith and belt of truth
We'll stand against the devil's lies
An army bold whose battle cry is Love
Reaching out to those in darkness

Our call to war to love the captive soul
But to rage against the captor
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole
We will fight with faith and valour
When faced with trials on every side
We know the outcome is secure
And Christ will have the prize for which He died
An inheritance of nations

Come see the cross where love and mercy meet
As the Son of God is stricken
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet
For the Conqueror has risen
And as the stone is rolled away
And Christ emerges from the grave
This victory march continues till the day
Every eye and heart shall see Him

So Spirit come put strength in every stride
Give grace for every hurdle
That we may run with faith to win the prize
Of a servant good and faithful
As saints of old still line the way
Retelling triumphs of His grace
We hear their calls and hunger for the day
When with Christ we stand in glory

65 O FOR A THOUSAND TONGUES TO SING

O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer's praise
The glories of my God and King
The triumphs of His grace

My gracious Master and my God
Assist me to proclaim
To spread thru all the earth abroad
The honors of Thy name

Jesus the name that charms our fears
That bids our sorrows cease
'Tis music in the sinner's ears
'Tis life and health and peace

He breaks the pow'r of canceled sin
He sets the pris'ner free
His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

Hear Him ye deaf His praise ye dumb
Your loosened tongues employ
Ye blind behold your Saviour come
And leap ye lame for joy

Glory to God and praise and love
Be ever ever giv'n
By saints below and saints above
The Church in earth and heav'n

66 O GOD OUR HELP IN AGES PAST

O God our help in ages past
Our hope for years to come
Our shelter from the stormy blast
And our eternal home

Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure
Sufficient is Thine arm alone
And our defense is sure

Before the hills in order stood
Or earth received her frame
From everlasting Thou art God
To endless years the same

Thy Word commands our flesh to dust
Return ye sons of men
All nations rose from earth at first
And turn to earth again

A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising sun

The busy tribes of flesh and blood
With all their lives and cares
Are carried downwards by the flood
And lost in following years

Time like an ever rolling stream
Bears all its sons away
They fly forgotten as a dream
Dies at the op'ning day

Like flowery fields the nations stand
Pleased with the morning light
The flowers beneath the mower's hand
Lie withering ere 'tis night

Our God our help in ages past
Our hope for years to come
Be Thou our guard while troubles last
And our eternal home

67 O GREAT GOD

O great God of highest heav'n
Occupy my lowly heart
Own it all and reign supreme
Conquer ev'ry rebel pow'r
Let no vice or sin remain
That resists Your holy war
You have loved and purchased me
Make me Yours forever more

I was blinded by my sin
Had no ears to hear Your voice
Did not know Your love within
Had no taste for heaven's joys
Then Your Spirit gave me life
Opened up Your word to me
Through the gospel of Your Son
Gave me endless hope and peace

Help me now to live a life
That's dependent on Your grace
Keep my heart and guard my soul
From the evils that I face

You are worthy to be praised
With my ev'ry thought and deed
O great God of highest heav'n
Glorify Your Name through me

68 O JESUS I HAVE PROMISED

O Jesus I have promised
To serve Thee to the end
Be Thou forever near me
My Master and my friend
I shall not fear the battle
If Thou art by my side
Nor wander from the pathway
If Thou wilt be my Guide

O let me feel Thee near me
The world is ever near
I see the sights that dazzle
The tempting sounds I hear
My foes are ever near me
Around me and within
But Jesus draw Thou nearer
And shield my soul from sin

O let me hear Thee speaking
In accents clear and still
Above the storms of passion
The murmurs of self will
O speak to reassure me
To hasten or control
O speak and make me listen
Thou guardian of my soul

O Jesus Thou hast promised
To all who follow Thee
That where Thou art in glory
There shall Thy servant be
And Jesus I have promised
To serve Thee to the end
O give me grace to follow
My Master and my friend

O let me see Thy footmarks
And in them plant mine own
My hope to follow duly
Is in thy strength alone
O guide me call me draw me
Uphold me to the end
And then in heaven receive me
My Saviour and my friend

69 O LOVE THAT WILT NOT LET ME GO

O Love that wilt not let me go
I rest my weary soul in Thee
I give Thee back the life I owe
That in Thine ocean depths its flow
May richer fuller be

O Light that followest all my way
I yield my flickering torch to Thee
My heart restores its borrowed ray
That in Thy sunshine's blaze its day
May brighter fairer be

O Joy that seekest me through pain
I cannot close my heart to Thee
I trace the rainbow through the rain
And feel the promise is not vain
That morn shall tearless be

O Cross that liftest up my head
I dare not ask to fly from Thee
I lay in dust life's glory dead
And from the ground there blossoms red
Life that shall endless be

70 O THE DEEP DEEP LOVE OF JESUS

O the deep deep love of Jesus
Vast unmeasured boundless free
Rolling as a mighty ocean
In its fullness over me
Underneath me all around me
Is the current of Thy love
Leading onward leading homeward
To my glorious rest above

O the deep deep love of Jesus
Spread His praise from shore to shore
How He loveth ever loveth
Changeth never nevermore
How He watches o'er His loved ones
Died to call them all His own
How for them He intercedeth
Watches over them from the throne

O the deep deep love of Jesus
Love of every love the best
'Tis an ocean vast of blessing
'Tis a haven sweet of rest
O the deep deep love of Jesus
'Tis a heaven of heavens to me
And it lifts me up to glory
For it lifts me up to Thee

71 OH HOW GOOD IT IS

Oh how good it is
When the family of God
Dwells together in spirit
In faith and unity
Where the bonds of peace
Of acceptance and love
Are the fruit of His presence
Here among us

So with one voice we'll sing to the Lord
And with one heart we'll live out His word
Till the whole earth sees
The Redeemer has come
For He dwells in the presence of His people

Oh how good it is
On this journey we share
To rejoice with the happy
And weep with those who mourn
For the weak find strength
The afflicted find grace
When we offer the blessing
Of belonging

Oh how good it is
To embrace His command
To prefer one another
Forgive as He forgives
When we live as one
We all share in the love
Of the Son with the Father
And the Spirit

72 ONLY BY GRACE

Only by grace can we enter
Only by grace can we stand
Not by our human endeavor
But by the blood of the Lamb
Into Your presence You call us
You call us to come
Into Your presence You draw us
And now by Your grace we come
Now by Your grace we come

Lord if You mark
Our transgressions
Who would stand
Thanks to Your grace
We are cleansed
By the blood of the Lamb

73 THE POWER OF THE CROSS

Oh to see the dawn of the darkest day
Christ on the road to Calvary
Tried by sinful men torn and beaten then
Nailed to a cross of wood

This the pow'r of the cross
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross

Oh to see the pain written on Your face
Bearing the awesome weight of sin
Ev'ry bitter thought ev'ry evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained brow

Now the daylight flees now the ground beneath
Quakes as its Maker bows His head
Curtain torn in two dead are raised to life
Finished the vict'ry cry

Oh to see my name written in the wounds
For through Your suff'ring I am free
Death is crushed to death life is mine to live
Won through Your selfless love

This the pow'r of the cross
Son of God slain for us
What a love what a cost
We stand forgiven at the cross

74 PRAISE MY SOUL THE KING OF HEAVEN

Praise my soul the King of heaven
To His feet thy tribute bring
Ransomed healed restored forgiven
Who like thee His praise should sing
Praise Him Praise Him
Praise Him Praise Him
Praise the everlasting King

Praise Him for His grace and favour
To our fathers in distress
Praise Him still the same forever
Slow to chide and swift to bless
Praise Him Praise Him

Glorious in His faithfulness

Father-like He tends and spares us
Well our feeble frame He knows
In His hands He gently bears us
Rescues us from all our foes

Widely as His mercy flows

Angels in the height adore Him
Ye behold Him face to face
Sun and moon bow down before Him
Dwellers all in time and space

75 PRAISE TO THE LORD THE ALMIGHTY

Praise to the Lord the Almighty
The King of creation
O my soul praise Him
For He is thy health and salvation
All ye who hear now to His temple draw near
Praise Him in glad adoration

Praise to the Lord Who over all things
So wondrously reigneth
Shelters thee under His wings
Yea so gently sustaineth
Hast thou not seen how thy desires ever have been
Granted in what He ordaineth

Praise to the Lord Who doth prosper
Thy work and defend thee
Surely His goodness and mercy
here daily attend thee
Ponder anew what the Almighty can do
If with His love He befriend thee

Praise to the Lord Who
When tempests their warfare are waging
Who when the elements madly
around thee are raging
Biddeth them cease turneth their fury to peace
Whirlwinds and waters assuaging

Praise to the Lord Who
When darkness of sin is abounding
Who when the godless do triumph
All virtue confounding
Sheddeth His light chaseth the horrors of night
Saints with His mercy surrounding

Praise to the Lord
O let all that is in me adore Him
All that hath life and breath
Come now with praises before Him
Let the amen sound from His people again
Gladly for all we adore Him

76 ROCK OF AGES

Rock of Ages cleft for me
Let me hide myself in thee
Let the water and the blood
From thy wounded side which flowed
Be of sin the double cure
Save from wrath and make me pure

Not the labours of my hands
Can fulfil thy law's demands
Could my zeal no respite know
Could my tears forever flow
All for sin could not atone
Thou must save and thou alone

Nothing in my hand I bring
Simply to the cross I cling
Naked come to thee for dress
Helpless look to thee for grace
Foul I to the fountain fly
Wash me Saviour or I die

While I draw this fleeting breath
When mine eyes shall close in death
When I soar to worlds unknown
See thee on thy judgment throne
Rock of Ages cleft for me
Let me hide myself in thee

77 SALVATION BELONGS TO OUR GOD

Salvation belongs to our God
Who sits upon the throne
And unto the Lamb
Praise and glory wisdom and thanks
Honour and power and strength

Be to our God forever and ever
Be to our God forever and ever
Be to our God forever and ever
Amen

And we the redeemed shall be strong
In purpose and unity
Declaring aloud
Praise and glory wisdom and thanks
Honour and power and strength

Praise and glory wisdom and thanks
Honour and power and strength

78 SERVANTS OF THE GOSPEL

As servants of the gospel
Christ's work we carry on
That through our prayer and witness
By grace we might win some
We call on every nation
To turn to Christ the Lord
Refuge in His mercy
And marvel at His love

Though we were undeserving
Christ died to wash us clean
He bore the Father's anger
While nailed upon the tree
In darkness and in turmoil
The judgment fell on Him
Bringing us forgiveness
That new life might begin

The grave could not contain Him
From death the Son broke free
Exalted by His Father
To rule eternally
And in His grace He calls us
To be His chosen church
As His holy temple
His priests to all the earth

Marked with His Holy Spirit
And guided by His word
Christ gathers us together
Prepares us for good works
And so with grace apportioned
We serve each others needs
Sharing in each blessing
And helping in our grief

Riches for the needy soul

You have the words of eternal life

All Your purposes for Your glory

And by faith we'll walk as You walk with us

And the earth is filled with Your glory

81 TAKE MY LIFE AND LET IT BE

Take my life and let it be
Consecrated Lord to Thee
Take my moments and my days
Let them flow in ceaseless praise

Take my hands and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love
Take my feet and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee

Take my voice and let me sing
Always only for my King
Take my lips and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee

Take my silver and my gold
Not a mite would I withhold
Take my intellect and use
Ev'ry pow'r as Thou shalt choose

Take my will and make it Thine
It shall be no longer mine
Take my heart it is Thine own
It shall be Thy royal throne

Take my love my Lord I pour
At Thy feet its treasure store
Take myself and I will be
Ever only all for Thee

82 TELL OUT MY SOUL

Tell out my soul the greatness of the Lord
Unnumbered blessings give my spirit voice
Tender to me the promise of His word
In God my Saviour shall my heart rejoice

Tell out my soul the greatness of His Name
Make known His might the deeds His arm has done
His mercy sure from age to age the same
His holy Name the Lord the Mighty One

Tell out my soul the greatness of His might
Powers and dominions lay their glory by
Proud hearts and stubborn wills are put to flight
The hungry fed the humble lifted high

Tell out my soul the glories of His word
Firm is His promise and His mercy sure
Tell out my soul the greatness of the Lord
To children's children and for evermore

83 THANK YOU FOR THE CROSS

Thank You for the cross
The mighty cross
That God Himself should die
For such as us
And ev'ryday we're changed
Into Your image more and more
Yes by the cross
We've truly been transformed

And we're so amazed
And we give You praise
That You would save us
At such a cost
We're so amazed
And we give You praise
For the power of the cross
For the power of the cross

84 THE CHURCH'S ONE FOUNDATION

The Church's one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord
She is His new creation
By water and the Word
From heav'n He came and sought her
To be His holy bride
With His own blood He bought her
And for her life He died

Elect from every nation
Yet one o'er all the earth
Her charter of salvation
One Lord one faith one birth
One holy name she blesses
Partakes one holy food
And to one hope she presses
With every grace endued

'Mid toil and tribulation
And tumult of her war
She waits the consummation
Of peace forevermore
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the Church at rest

Yet she on earth hath union
With God the Three in One
And mystic sweet communion
With those whose rest is won
O happy ones and holy
Lord give us grace that we
Like them the meek and lowly
On high may dwell with Thee

85 THE LORD IS MY SALVATION

The grace of God has reached for me
And pulled me from the raging sea
And I am safe on this solid ground
The Lord is my salvation

I will not fear when darkness falls
His strength will help me scale these walls
I'll see the dawn of the rising sun
The Lord is my salvation

Who is like the Lord our God
Strong to save faithful in love
My debt is paid and the victory won
The Lord is my salvation

My hope is hidden in the Lord
He flow'rs each promise of His Word
When winter fades I know spring will come
The Lord is my salvation

In times of waiting times of need
When I know loss when I am weak
I know His grace will renew these days
The Lord is my salvation

And when I reach the final day
He will not leave me in the grave
But I will rise He will call me home
The Lord is my salvation

Glory be to God the Father
Glory be to God the Son
Glory be to God the Spirit
The Lord is our salvation

The Lord is our salvation
The Lord is our salvation

86 THE LOVE OF GOD

The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell
It goes beyond the highest star
And reaches to the lowest hell
The guilty pair bowed down with care
God gave His Son to win
His erring child He reconciled
And pardoned from his sin

O love of God how rich and pure
How measureless and strong
It shall forevermore endure
The saints and angels song

When years of time shall pass away
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall
When men who here refuse to pray
On rocks and hills and mountains call
God's love so sure shall still endure
All measureless and strong
Redeeming grace to Adam's race
The saints and angels song

Could we with ink the ocean fill
And were the skies of parchment made
Were every stalk on earth a quill
And every man a scribe by trade
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry
Nor could the scroll contain the whole
Though stretched from sky to sky

87 THE PERFECT WISDOM OF OUR GOD

The perfect wisdom of our God
Revealed in all the universe
All things created by His hand
And held together at His command
He knows the myst'ries of the seas
The secrets of the stars are His
He guides the planets on their way
And turns the earth through another day

The matchless wisdom of His ways
That mark the path of righteousness
His word a lamp unto my feet
His Spirit teaching and guiding me
And O the mystery of the cross
That God should suffer for the lost
So that the fool might shame the wise
And all the glory might go to Christ

O grant me wisdom from above
To pray for peace and cling to love
And teach me humbly to receive
The sun and rain of Your sovereignty
Each strand of sorrow has a place
Within this tapestry of grace
So through the trials I choose to say
Your perfect will in Your perfect way

88 THE SERVANT KING

From heav'n You came helpless babe
Enter'd our world Your glory veil'd
Not to be served but to serve
And give Your life that we might live

This is our God the Servant King
He calls us now to follow Him
To bring our lives as a daily offering
Of worship to the Servant King

There in the garden of tears
My heavy load He chose to bear
His heart with sorrow was torn
Yet not my will but Yours He said

Come see His hands and His feet
The scars that speak of sacrifice
Hands that flung stars into space
To cruel nails surrendered

So let us learn how to serve
And in our lives enthrone Him
Each other's needs to prefer
For it is Christ we're serving

89 THERE IS A FOUNTAIN

There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel's veins
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day
And there may I though vile as he
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
And there may I though vile as he
Wash all my sins away

Dear dying Lamb Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its pow'r
Till all the ransomed Church of God
Be saved to sin no more
Be saved to sin no more
Be saved to sin no more
Till all the ransomed Church of God
Be saved to sin no more

E'er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die

When this poor lisping stamm'ring tongue
Lies silent in the grave
Then in a nobler sweeter song
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save
Then in a nobler sweeter song
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save

90 THERE IS A HIGHER THRONE

There is a higher throne
Than all this world has known
Where faithful ones from ev'ry tongue
Will one day come
Before the Son we'll stand
Made faultless through the Lamb
Believing hearts find promised grace
Salvation come

Hear heaven's voices sing
Their thund'rous anthem rings
Through em'rald courts and sapphire skies
Their praises rise
All glory wisdom pow'r
Strength thanks and honour are
To God our King who reigns on high
Forever more

And there we'll find our home
Our life before the throne
We'll honour Him in perfect song
Where we belong
He'll wipe each tear-stained eye
As thirst and hunger die
The Lamb becomes our Shepherd King
We'll reign with Him

91 THERE IS A HOPE

There is a hope that burns within my heart
That gives me strength for ev'ry passing day
A glimpse of glory now revealed in meager part
Yet drives all doubt away
I stand in Christ with sins forgiv'n
And Christ in me the hope of heav'n
My highest calling and my deepest joy
To make His will my home

There is a hope that lifts my weary head
A consolation strong against despair
That when the world has plunged me
In its deepest pit
I find the Saviour there
Through present suff'rings future's fear
He whispers courage in my ear
For I am safe in everlasting arms
And they will lead me home

There is a hope that stands the test of time
That lifts my eyes beyond the beck'ning grave
To see the matchless beauty of a day divine
When I behold His face
When suff'rings cease and sorrows die
And ev'ry longing satisfied
Then joy unspeakable will flood my soul
For I am truly home

When suff'rings cease and sorrows die
And ev'ry longing satisfied
Then joy unspeakable will flood my soul
For I am truly home

92 THIS KINGDOM

Jesus God's righteousness revealed
The Son of Man the Son of God
His kingdom comes
Jesus redemption's sacrifice
Now glorified now justified
His kingdom comes

And this kingdom will know no end
And its glory shall know no bounds
For the majesty and power
Of this kingdom's King has come
And this kingdom's reign
And this kingdom's rule
And this kingdom's power and authority
Jesus God's righteousness revealed

Jesus the expression of God's love
The grace of God the Word of God
Revealed to us
Jesus God's holiness displayed
Now glorified now justified
His kingdom comes

93 THIS LIFE I LIVE

This life I live is not my own
For my Redeemer paid the price
He took it to be His alone
To be His treasure and His prize
The things of earth I leave behind
To live in worship of my King
His is the right to rule my life
Mine is the joy to live for Him

I died to sin upon the cross
I'm bound to Jesus in His death
The old is gone and now I must
Rely on Him for ev'ry breath
With ev'ry footstep that I tread
What mysteries He has in store
I cannot know what lies ahead
But know that He has gone before

There is a voice that pierced the grave
A power that rolled the stone away
A sound of life I know I'm saved
The voice of God has called my name
So I will rise and in the air
Behold the glory of the King
I will not fear to meet Him there
I know my life is hid with Him

94 'TIS SO SWEET TO TRUST IN JESUS

'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to take Him at His word
Just to rest upon His promise
Just to know thus saith the Lord

Jesus Jesus how I trust Him
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er
Jesus Jesus precious Jesus
O for grace to trust Him more

O how sweet to trust in Jesus
Just to trust His cleansing blood
Just in simple faith to plunge me
'Neath the healing cleansing flood

Yes 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus
Just from sin and self to cease
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest and joy and peace

I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee
Precious Jesus Saviour Friend
And I know that Thou art with me
Wilt be with me to the end

95 TO GOD BE THE GLORY

To God be the glory great things He has done
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin
And opened the life gate that all may go in

Praise the Lord praise the Lord
Let the earth hear His voice
Praise the Lord praise the Lord
Let the people rejoice
O come to the Father through Jesus the Son
And give Him the glory great things He has done

O perfect redemption the purchase of blood
To every believer the promise of God
The vilest offender who truly believes
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives

Great things He has taught us
Great things He has done
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son
But purer and higher and greater will be
Our wonder our transport when Jesus we see

96 TURN YOUR EYES UPON JESUS

O soul are you weary and troubled
No light in the darkness you see
There's light for a look at the Saviour
And life more abundant and free

Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in His wonderful face
And the things of earth
Will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace

Through death into life everlasting
He passed and we follow Him there
Over us sin no more hath dominion
For more than conquerors we are

His Word shall not fail you He promised
Believe Him and all will be well
Then go to a world that is dying
His perfect salvation to tell

97 WHAT GRACE IS MINE

What grace is mine
That He who dwells in endless light
Called through the night
To find my distant soul
And from His scars
Poured mercy that would plead for me
That I might live
And in His name be known

So I will go wherever He is calling me
I lose my life to find my life in Him
I give my all to gain the hope that never dies
I bow my heart take up my cross and follow Him

What grace is mine
To know His breath alive in me
Beneath His wings
My wakened soul may soar
All fear can flee
For death's dark night is overcome
My Saviour lives
And reigns forevermore

I bow my heart take up my cross and follow Him

98 WHEN I SURVEY THE WONDROUS CROSS

When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died
My richest gain I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride

Forbid it Lord that I should boast
Save in the death of Christ my God
All the vain things that charm me most
I sacrifice them to His blood

See from His head His hands His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did ever such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown

His dying crimson like a robe
Spreads o'er His body on the tree
Then I am dead to all the globe
And all the globe is dead to me

Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were a present (an offering) far too small
Love so amazing so divine
Demands my soul my life my all

99 WITH JOY WE MEDITATE THE GRACE

With joy we meditate the grace
Of our High Priest above
His heart is made of tenderness
It overflows with love

Touched with a sympathy within
He knows our feeble frame
He knows what sore temptations mean
For He has felt the same

He in the days of feeble flesh
Poured out His cries and tears
And now exalted feels afresh
What every member bears

He'll never quench the smoking flax
But raise it to a flame
The bruised reed He never breaks
Nor scorns the meanest name

Then let our humble faith address
His mercy and His power
We shall obtain delivering grace
In the distressing hour

100 YET NOT I BUT THROUGH CHRIST IN ME

What gift of grace is Jesus my redeemer
There is no more for heaven now to give
He is my joy my righteousness and freedom
My steadfast love my deep and boundless peace

To this I hold my hope is only Jesus
For my life is wholly bound to his
Oh how strange and divine I can sing all is mine
Yet not I but through Christ in me

The night is dark but I am not forsaken
For by my side the Saviour he will stay
I labour on in weakness and rejoicing
For in my need his power is displayed

To this I hold my Shepherd will defend me
Through the deepest valley he will lead
Oh the night has been won and I shall overcome
Yet not I but through Christ in me

No fate I dread I know I am forgiven
The future sure the price it has been paid
For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
And he was raised to overthrow the grave

To this I hold my sin has been defeated
Jesus now and ever is my plea
Oh the chains are released I can sing I am free
Yet not I but through Christ in me

With every breath I long to follow Jesus
For he has said that he will bring me home
And day by day I know he will renew me
Until I stand with joy before the throne

To this I hold my hope is only Jesus
All the glory evermore to him
When the race is complete still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I but through Christ in me

When the race is complete still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I but through Christ in me
Yet not I but through Christ in me

101 10,000 REASONS

Bless the Lord O my soul O my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name

The sun comes up it's a new day dawning
It's time to sing Your song again
Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me
Let me be singing when the evening comes

You're rich in love and You're slow to anger
Your name is great and Your heart is kind
For all Your goodness I will keep on singing
Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find

And on that day when my strength is failing
The end draws near and my time has come
Still my soul will sing Your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forevermore

102 ABBA FATHER WE APPROACH THEE

Abba Father we approach Thee
In our Saviour's precious name
We, thy children, here assembling
Now the promised blessing claim
From our sins His blood hath washed us
’Tis through Him our souls draw nigh
And thy Spirit, too, has taught us
“Abba, Father,” thus to cry

Once as prodigals we wandered
In our folly far from thee
But thy grace, o’er sin abounding
Rescued us from misery
Thou thy prodigals hast pardoned
Loved us with a Father’s love
Welcomed us with joy o’erflowing
E’er to dwell with thee above

Clothed in garments of salvation
At Thy table is our place
We rejoice, and thou rejoicest
In the riches of thy grace
"It is meet," we hear thee saying
"We should merry and be glad
I have found my once lost children
Now they live who once were dead!"

"Abba, Father!" all adore thee
All rejoice in Heav’n above
While in us they learn the wonders
Of thy wisdom, grace, and love
Soon before thy throne assembled
All thy children shall proclaim
"Glory, everlasting glory
Be to God and to the Lamb!"

103 ACROSS THE LANDS

You're the Word of God the Father
From before the world began
Ev'ry star and ev'ry planet
Has been fashioned by Your hand
All creation holds together
By the power of Your voice
Let the skies declare Your glory
Let the land and seas rejoice

You're the author of creation
You're the Lord of ev'ry man
And Your cry of love rings out
Across the lands

Yet You left the gaze of angels
Came to seek and save the lost
And exchanged the joy of heaven
For the anguish of a cross
With a prayer You fed the hungry
With a word You stilled the sea
Yet how silently You suffered
That the guilty may go free

With a shout You rose victorious
Wresting victory from the grave
And ascended into heaven
Leading captives in Your wake
Now You stand before the Father
Interceding for Your own
From each tribe and tongue and nation
You are leading sinners home

104 ALAS AND DID MY SAVIOUR BLEED

Alas and did my Saviour bleed
And did my Sov'reign die
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I

Was it for crimes that I had done
He groaned upon the tree
Amazing pity grace unknown
And love beyond degree

Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut His glories in
When Christ the mighty Maker died
For man the creature's sin

Thus might I hide my blushing face
While His dear cross appears
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness
And melt my eyes to tears

But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe
Here Lord I give myself away
'Tis all that I can do

105 AMAZING GRACE (MY CHAINS ARE GONE)

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

My chains are gone I've been set free
My God my Saviour has ransomed me
And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love amazing grace

The Lord has promised good to me
His word my hope secures
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
The sun forbear to shine
But God who called me here below
Will be forever mine
Will be forever mine
You are forever mine

106 ANCIENT OF DAYS

Though the nations rage
Kingdoms rise and fall
There is still one King
Reigning over all
So I will not fear
For this truth remains
That my God is the Ancient of Days

None above Him none before Him
All of time in His hands
For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
All the power all the glory
I will trust in His name
For my God is the Ancient of days

Though the dread of night
Overwhelms my soul
He is here with me
I am not alone
O His love is sure
And He knows my name
For my God is the Ancient of Days

Though I may not see
What the future brings
I will watch and wait
For the Saviour king
Then my joy complete
Standing face to face
In the presence of the Ancient of Days

107 ANGELS WE HAVE HEARD ON HIGH

Angels we have heard on high
Singing sweetly o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

Gloria in excelsis Deo gloria in excelsis Deo

Shepherds why this jubilee
Why these joyous strains prolong
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heav'nly song

Gloria in excelsis Deo gloria in excelsis Deo

Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord the newborn King

Gloria in excelsis Deo gloria in excelsis Deo

108 AS THE DEER

As the deer panteth for the water
So my soul longeth after Thee
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship Thee

You alone are my strength my shield
To You alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship Thee

You're my friend and You are my brother
Even though You are a King
I love You more than any other
So much more than anything

I want You more than gold or silver
Only You can satisfy
You alone are the real joygiver
And the apple of my eye

109 BE STILL MY SOUL

Be still my soul the Lord is on thy side
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain
Leave to thy God to order and provide
In ev’ry change He faithful will remain
Be still my soul thy best thy heav’nly Friend
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end

Be still my soul thy God doth undertake
To guide the future as He has the past
Thy hope thy confidence let nothing shake
All now mysterious shall be bright at last
Be still my soul the waves and winds still know
His voice who ruled them while He dwelt below

Be still my soul the hour is hast'ning on
When we shall be forever with the Lord
When disappointment grief and fear are gone
Sorrow forgot love's purest joys restored
Be still my soul when change and tears are past
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last

110 BLESSED BE GOD OUR GOD

Blessed be God, our God,
Who gave for us His well-beloved Son,
The gift of gifts, all other gifts in one;
Blessed be God, our God!

What will He not bestow!
Who freely gave this mighty gift unbought,
Unmerited, unheeded, and unsought,
What will He not bestow?

He spared not His Son!
’Tis this that silences each rising fear,
’Tis this that bids the hard thought disappear;
He spared not His Son!

Who shall condemn us now?
Since Christ has died, and ris’n, and gone above,
For us to plead at the right hand of Love;
Who shall condemn us now?

Tis God that justifies!
Who shall recall His pardon or His grace?
Or who the broken chain of guilt replace?
’Tis God that justifies!

The victory is ours!
For us in might came forth the mighty One;
For us He fought the fight, the triumph won:
The victory is ours!

111 BORN TO SERVE THE LORD

From the dust of the earth
My God created man
His breath made man a living soul
And God so loved the world
He gave His only Son
And that is why I love Him so

For I was made in His likeness
Created in His image
For I was born to serve the Lord
And I can't deny Him
I will always walk beside Him
For I was born to serve the Lord

My hands were made to help my neighbour
My eyes were made to read God's word
And my feet were made
To walk in His footsteps
My body is the temple of the Lord

112 BREAK THOU THE BREAD OF LIFE

Break Thou the bread of life dear Lord to me
As Thou didst break the loaves beside the sea
Beyond the sacred page I seek Thee Lord
My spirit pants for Thee O Living Word

Bless Thou the truth dear Lord to me to me
As Thou didst bless the bread by Galilee
Then shall bondage cease all fetters fall
And I shall find my peace my all in all

Thou art the bread of life O Lord to me
Thy holy Word the truth that saveth me
Give me to eat and live with Thee above
Teach me to love Thy truth for Thou art love

O send Thy Spirit Lord now unto me
That He may touch my eyes and make me see
Show me the truth concealed within Thy Word
And in Thy Book revealed I see Thee Lord

113 CALVARY COVERS IT ALL

Far dearer than all
That the world can impart
Was the message that came to my heart
How that Jesus alone
For my sin did atone
And Calvary covers it all

Calvary covers it all
My past with its sin and stain
My guilt and despair
Jesus took on Him there
And Calvary covers it all

The stripes that He bore
And the thorns that He wore
Told His mercy and love evermore
And my heart bowed in shame
As I called on His name
And Calvary covers it all

How matchless the grace
When I looked on the face
Of this Jesus my crucified Lord
My redemption complete
I then found at His feet
And Calvary covers it all

How blessed the tho't
That my soul by Him bo't
Shall be His in the glory on high
Where with gladness and song
I'll be one of the throng
And Calvary covers it all

114 CHRIST IS MINE FOREVERMORE

Mine are days that God has numbered
I was made to walk with Him
Yet I look for worldly treasure
And forsake the King of kings
But mine is hope in my Redeemer
Though I fall His love is sure
For Christ has paid for every failing
I am His forevermore

Mine are tears in times of sorrow
Darkness not yet understood
Through the valley I must travel
Where I see no earthly good
But mine is peace that flows from heaven
And the strength in times of need
I know my pain will not be wasted
Christ completes His work in me

Mine are days here as a stranger
Pilgrim on a narrow way
One with Christ I will encounter
Harm and hatred for His name
But mine is armour for this battle
Strong enough to last the war
And He has said He will deliver
Safely to the golden shore

And mine are keys to Zion city
Where beside the King I walk
For there my heart has found its treasure
Christ is mine forevermore
Come rejoice now O my soul
For His love is my reward
Fear is gone and hope is sure
Christ is mine forevermore

116 COME, EVERY JOYFUL HEART

Come, every joyful heart
That loves the Saviour's name
Your noblest powers exert
To celebrate his fame
Tell all above, and all below
That debt of love, to him you owe

He left his starry crown
And laid His robes aside
On wings of love came down
And wept, and bled, and died
What he endur'd, no who can tell?
To save our souls from death and hell

From the dark grave he rose
The mansions of the dead
And thence his mighty foes
In glorious triumph led
Up thro' the sky the conqueror rode
And reigns on high, the saviour God

From thence he'll quickly come
His chariot will not stay
And bear our spirits home
To realms of endless day
There shall we see his lovely face
And ever be in his embrace

Jesus, we ne'er can pay
The debt we owe thy love
Yet, tell us how we may
Our gratitude approve
Our hearts, our all, to thee we give
The gift, tho' small, thou wilt receive

117 COME, THOU ALMIGHTY KING

Come, thou almighty King
Help us thy name to sing
Help us to praise
Father all-glorious
O'er all victorious
Come and reign over us
Ancient of Days

Come, thou incarnate Word
Gird on thy mighty sword
Our prayer attend
Come and thy people bless
And give thy Word success
And let thy righteousness
On us descend

Come, holy Comforter
Thy sacred witness bear
In this glad hour
Thou, who almighty art
Now rule in ev'ry heart
And ne'er from us depart
Spirit of pow'r

To thee, great One in Three
Eternal praises be
Hence evermore
Thy sovereign majesty
May we in glory see
And to eternity
Love and adore

118 COME THOU LONG EXPECTED JESUS

Come Thou long expected Jesus
Born to set Thy people free
From our fears and sins release us
Let us find our rest in Thee
Israel's strength and consolation
Hope of all the earth Thou art
Dear desire of every nation
Joy of every longing heart

Born Thy people to deliver
Born a child and yet a King
Born to reign in us forever
Now Thy gracious Kingdom bring
By Thine own eternal Spirit
Rule in all our hearts alone
By Thine all sufficient merit
Raise us to Thy glorious throne

119 DEEPER DEEPER

Deeper deeper in the love of Jesus
Daily let me go
Higher higher in the school of wisdom
More of grace to know

O deeper yet I pray
And higher ev'ry day
And wiser blessed Lord
In Thy precious holy Word

Deeper deeper blessed Holy Spirit
Take me deeper still
Till my life is wholly lost in Jesus
And His perfect will

Deeper deeper though it cost hard trials
Deeper let me go
Rooted in the holy love of Jesus
Let me fruitful grow

Deeper higher ev'ry day in Jesus
Till all conflict past
Finds me conqu'ror and in His own image
Perfected at last

120 DONE IS THE WORK THAT SAVES

Done is the work that saves
Once and for ever done
Finished the righteousness
That clothes the unrighteous one
The love that blesses us below
Is flowing freely to us now

The sacrifice is o'er
The veil is rent in twain
The mercy-seat is red
With blood of victim slain
Why stand we then without, in fear?
The blood divine invites us near

The gate is open wide
The new and living way
Is clear and free and bright
With love and peace and day
Into the holiest now we come
Our present and our endless home

Upon the mercy-seat
The High Priest sits within
The blood is in His hand
Which makes and keeps us clean
With boldness let us now draw near
That blood has banished every fear

Then to the Lamb once slain
Be glory, praise, and power
Who died and lives again
Who liveth evermore
Who loved and washed us in His blood
Who made us kings and priests to God

121 EVERYBODY OUGHT TO KNOW

Everybody ought to know
Everybody ought to know
Everybody ought to know
Who Jesus is

He's the Lily of the Valley
He's the Bright and Morning Star
He's the fairest of ten thousand
Ev'rybody ought to know

On the cross he died for sinners
And his blood makes white as snow
Loving, living, coming Saviour
He's the one you ought to know

122 FAIREST LORD JESUS

Fairest Lord Jesus Ruler of all nature
O Thou of God and man the Son
Thee will I cherish Thee will I honour
Thou my soul's glory joy and crown

Fair are the meadows fairer still the woodlands
Robed in the blooming garb of spring
Jesus is fairer Jesus is purer
Who makes the woeful heart to sing

Fair is the sunshine fairer still the moonlight
And all the twinkling starry host
Jesus shines brighter Jesus shines purer
Than all the angels heav'n can boast

Beautiful Saviour Lord of all the nations
Son of God and Son of Man
Glory and honour praise adoration
Now and forevermore be Thine

123 FATHER I THANK YOU

Father I thank You for all that You've done
You gave Your Son freely for me
And I praise You for calling me drawing me near
Out of blindness You caused me to see

Spirit of life You are God's holy fire
You've kindled my heart with Your blaze
And I know You're refining me changing my life
And by faith You're revealing Your ways

Jesus I need You as Lord of my life
I give all I have unto You
Lord I want to come under Your heavenly hand
And to praise You in all that I do

124 FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE EARTH

For the beauty of the earth
For the glory of the skies
For the love which from our birth
Over and around us lies

Gracious God to Thee we raise
This our sacrifice of praise

For the beauty of each hour
Of the day and of the night
Hill and vale and tree and flower
Sun and moon and stars of light

For the joy of ear and eye
For the heart and mind's delight
For the mystic harmony
Linking sense to sound and sight

For the joy of human love
Brother sister parent child
Friends on earth and friends above
For all gentle thoughts and mild

For each perfect gift of Thine
To our race so freely given
Graces human and divine
Flowers of earth and buds of heaven

125 FOR THE BREAD AND FOR THE WINE

For the bread and for the wine
For the pledge that seals Him mine
For the words of love divine
We give Thee thanks O Lord

For the feast of love and peace
Bidding all our sorrows cease
Earnest of the kingdom's bliss
We give Thee thanks O Lord

Only bread and only wine
Yet to faith the solemn sign
Of the heavenly and divine
We give Thee thanks O Lord

For the words that turn our eye
To the cross of Calvary
Bidding us in faith draw nigh
We give Thee thanks O Lord

For the words that fragrance breathe
These poor symbols underneath
Words that His own peace bequeath
We give Thee thanks O Lord

For the words that tell of home
Pointing us beyond the tomb
'Do ye this until I come'
We give Thee thanks O Lord

126 GATHERED LORD AROUND THY TABLE

Gathered, Lord, around Thy table
Now we seek Thy face
Let us know Thy presence with us
Lord of grace

Love divine first drew us to Thee
In our sin and need
For our sin, in deep compassion
Thou didst bleed

Risen Lord, in glory seated
We are one with Thee
Thou hast snapt 
the chains that bound us
We are free

Gratefully we Thee remember
As we break the bread
Symbol of Thy body broken
In our stead

Drink we too the cup of blessing
Which Thy love has filled
Through Thy blood we have redemption
Fears are stilled

Backward look we, drawn to Calvary
Musing while we sing
Forward haste we to Thy coming
Lord and King

127 GENTLE AND LOWLY

Gentle and lowly patient and kind
Ever approachable saviour of mine
All of my weakness meets your embrace
Failure and sin meet compassion and grace
Gentle and lowly Patient and kind
Ever approachable saviour of mine

Seeing my suffering knowing my fear
Mercy compels you in love to draw near
Joy without measure flows through your soul
Taking my burdens and bearing them all
Seeing my suffering knowing my fear
Mercy compels you in love to draw near

Humble redeemer there on the tree
Nothing could stop you from suffering for me
Speechless in wonder angels above
Never had seen such self-emptying love
Humble redeemer there on the tree
Nothing could stop you from suffering for me

Gentle and lowly patient and kind
No other saviour like Jesus I find
Though my heart changes yours never does
Ever unchanging compassion and love
Gentle and lowly patient and kind
No other saviour like Jesus I find
No other saviour like Jesus I find

128 GETHSEMANE HYMN

To see the King of heaven fall
In anguish to His knees
The Light and Hope of all the world
Now overwhelmed with grief
What nameless horrors must He see
To cry out in the garden
Oh take this cup away from Me
Yet not My will but Yours
Yet not My will but Yours

To know each friend will fall away
And heaven's voice be still
For hell to have its vengeful day
Upon Golgotha's hill
No words describe the Saviour's plight
To be by God forsaken
Till wrath and love are satisfied
And every sin is paid
And every sin is paid

What took Him to this wretched place
What kept Him on this road
His love for Adam's cursed race
For every broken soul
No sin too slight to overlook
No crime too great to carry
All mingled in this poisoned cup
And yet He drank it all
The Saviour drank it all
The Saviour drank it all

129 GIVE ME A SIGHT O SAVIOUR

Give me a sight O Saviour
Of Your wondrous love to me
Of the love that brought You down to earth
To die on Calvary

O make me understand it
Help me to take it in
What it meant to You the Holy One
To bear away my sin

Was it the nails O Saviour
That bound You to the tree
No 'twas Your everlasting love
Your love for me for me

O wonder of all wonders
That through Your death for me
My open sins my secret sins
Can all forgiven be

Then melt my heart O Saviour
Bend me yes break me down
Until I own You conqueror
And Lord and Sovereign crown

130 GRACE GREATER THAN OUR SIN

Marvellous grace of our loving Lord
Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt
Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt

Grace grace God's grace
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within
Grace grace God's grace
Grace that is greater than all our sin

Sin and despair like the sea waves cold
Threaten the soul with infinite loss
Grace that is greater yes grace untold
Points to the refuge the mighty Cross

Dark is the stain that we cannot hide
What can avail to wash it away
Look there is flowing a crimson tide
Whiter than snow you may be today

Marvellous infinite matchless grace
Freely bestowed on all who believe
You that are longing to see His face
Will you this moment His grace receive

131 GUIDE ME O THOU GREAT JEHOVAH

Guide me O Thou great Jehovah
Pilgrim through this barren land
I am weak but Thou art mighty
Hold me with Thy pow'rful hand
Bread of heaven Bread of heaven
Feed me now and ever more
Feed me now and ever more

Open now the crystal fountain
Whence the healing stream doth flow
Let the fiery cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through
Strong Deliverer strong Deliverer
Be Thou still my strength and shield
Be Thou still my strength and shield

When I tread the verge of Jordan
Bid my anxious fears subside
Death of death and hell's destruction
Land me safe on Canaan's side
Songs of praises songs of praises
I will ever give to Thee
I will ever give to Thee

132 HARK THE HERALD ANGELS SING

Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With th'angelic hosts proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King

Christ by highest heav'n adored
Christ the everlasting Lord
Late in time behold Him come
Offspring of the Virgin's womb
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see
Hail th'incarnate Deity
Pleased as man with men to dwell
Jesus our Emmanuel
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King

Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace
Hail the Sun of Righteousness
Light and life to all He brings
Ris'n with healing in His wings
Mild He lays His glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King

Come Desire of nations come
Fix in us Thy humble home
Rise the woman's conqu’ring seed
Bruise in us the serpent's head
Adam’s likeness now efface
Stamp Thine image in its place
Second Adam from above
Reinstate us in Thy love
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King

133 HE CARES FOR ME

Our God is far greater
Than words can make known
Exalted and holy
He reigns on His throne
In infinite splendor
He rules over all
Yet He feeds the poor sparrows
And He knows when they fall

His power is great
And will ever endure
His wisdom is peaceable
Gentle and pure
But greater than all
These glories I see
Is the glorious promise
That He cares for me

The earth and the heaven's
Are the work of His hands
And billions of angels
Obey His commands
He guides the great galaxies
Spinning through space
Yet He gave us His Son
As a gift of His grace

He rides the wild heavens
He strides through the seas
The high mountains tremble
To hear His decrees
His voice with great thunderings
Sounds from above
But to His own children
He whispers His love

134 HOPE OF THE AGES

The prophets had glimpsed
And the angels had watched with awe
The unfolding plans of our faithful redeeming God
What they longed for we have seen
What was promised we believe

Hope of the Ages Isaiah's Great Light
Abraham's offspring
Blessing of Jacob Judah's might
Hope of the Ages David's true Son
Desire of nations promised salvation
God with us

The vision once clouded
Has now to our hearts appeared
Once shrouded in myst'ry
Redemption has been made clear
Our Messiah now has come
Word made Flesh the Saving One

All hail the One now revealed to the world
In Bethlehem born to a young virgin girl
Lamb without blemish yet cruelly betrayed
Who cried it is finished and rose from the grave
The Father's great gift and the proof of His love
Hope of the Ages our God here with us

135 HOW GREAT IS OUR GOD

The splendour of the King
Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
All the earth rejoice
He wraps Himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
And trembles at His voice

How great is our God
Sing with me
How great is our God
And all will see how great
How great is our God

And age to age He stands
And time is in His hands
Beginning and the End
Beginning and the End
The Godhead three in one
Father Spirit Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb

Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
My heart will sing
How great is our God

136 I STAND AMAZED

I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene
And wonder how He could love me
A sinner condemned unclean

How marvellous how wonderful
And my song shall ever be
How marvellous how wonderful
Is my Saviour's love for me

For me it was in the garden
He prayed not My will but Thine
He had no tears for His own griefs
But sweat drops of blood for mine

In pity angels beheld Him
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night

He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own
He bore the burden to Calvary
And suffered and died alone

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see
'Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me

137 I KNOW WHO HOLDS TOMORROW

I don't know about tomorrow
I just live from day to day
I don't borrow from its sunshine
For its skies may turn to gray
I don't worry o'er the future
For I know what Jesus said
And today I'll walk beside Him
For He knows what is ahead

Many things about tomorrow
I don't seem to understand
But I know who holds tomorrow
And I know who holds my hand

Ev'ry step is getting brighter
As the golden stairs I climb
Ev'ry burden's getting lighter
Ev'ry cloud is silver-lined
There the sun is always shining
There no tear will dim the eye
At the ending of the rainbow
Where the mountains touch the sky

I don't know about tomorrow
It may bring me poverty
But the One who feeds the sparrow
Is the One who stands by me
And the path that is my portion
May be through the flame or flood
But His presence goes before me
And I'm covered with His blood

138 I OFFER MY LIFE

All that I am all that I have
I lay them down before You O Lord
All my regrets all my acclaim
The joy and the pain
I'm making them Yours

Lord I offer my life to You
Everything I've been through
Use it for Your glory
Lord I offer my days to You
Lifting my praise to You
As a pleasing sacrifice
Lord I offer You my life

Things in the past things yet unseen
Wishes and dreams
That are yet to come true
All of my hopes all of my plans
My heart and my hands
Are lifted to You

What can we give
That You have not given
And what do we have
That is not already Yours
All we possess are
These lives we're living
And that's what
We give to You Lord

139 I WILL GLORY IN MY REDEEMER

I will glory in my Redeemer
Whose priceless blood has ransomed me
Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails
And hung Him on that judgment tree
I will glory in my Redeemer
Who crushed the power of sin and death
My only Saviour before the holy Judge
The Lamb Who is my righteousness
The Lamb Who is my righteousness

I will glory in my Redeemer
My life He bought my love He owns
I have no longings for another
I'm satisfied in Him alone
I will glory in my Redeemer
His faithfulness my standing place
Though foes are mighty and rush up on me
My feet are firm held by His grace
My feet are firm held by His grace

I will glory in my Redeemer
Who carries me on eagle's wings
He crowns my life with loving kindness
His triumph song I'll ever sing
I will glory in my Redeemer
Who waits for me at gates of gold
And when He calls me it will be paradise
His face forever to behold
His face forever to behold

140 I WILL SING THE WONDROUS STORY

I will sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me
How He left the realms of glory
For the cross on Calvary
Yes I'll sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me
Sing it with His saints in glory
Gathered by the crystal sea

I was lost but Jesus found me
Found the sheep that went astray
Raised me up and gently led me
Back into the narrow way
Days of darkness still may meet me
Sorrow's paths I oft may tread
But His presence still is with me
By His guiding hand I'm led

He will keep me till the river
Rolls its waters at my feet
Then He'll bear me safely over
Made by grace for glory meet
Yes I'll sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me
Sing it with His saints in glory
Gathered by the crystal sea

141 I WORSHIP YOU ALMIGHTY GOD

I worship You Almighty God
There is none like You
I worship You O Prince of Peace
That is what I want to do
I give You praise
For You are my righteousness
I worship You Almighty God
There is none like You

142 IF THAT ISN'T LOVE

He left the splendour of heaven
Knowing His destiny
Was the lonely hill of Golgotha
There to lay down His life for me

If that isn't love
The ocean is dry
There's no star in the sky
And the sparrow can't fly
If that isn't love
Then heaven's a myth
There's no feeling like this
If that isn't love

Even in death He remembered
The thief hanging by His side
He spoke with love and compassion
Then He took him to paradise

143 IS HE WORTHY

Do you feel the world is broken?
We do
Do you feel the shadows deepen?
We do
But do you know that all the dark
Won't stop the light from getting through?
We do
Do you wish that you could see it all made new?
We do

Is all creation groaning?
It is
Is a new creation coming?
It is
Is the glory of the Lord
To be the light within our midst?
It is
Is it good that we remind ourselves of this?
It is

Is anyone worthy?
Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He is David's Root
And the Lamb who died to ransom the slave
Is He worthy?
Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honour and glory?
Is He worthy of this?
He is

Does the Father truly love us?
He does
Does the Spirit move among us?
He does
And does Jesus our Messiah
Hold forever those He loves?
He does
Does our God intend to dwell again with us?
He does

Is anyone worthy?
Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He is David's Root
And the Lamb who died to ransom the slave

From ev'ry people and tribe every nation and tongue
He has made us a kingdom and priests
To God to reign with the Son
Is He worthy?
Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honour and glory?
Is He worthy?
Is He worthy?
Is He worthy of this?
He is

Is He worthy?
Is He worthy?
He is
He is

144 IT IS A THING MOST WONDERFUL

It is a thing most wonderful
Almost too wonderful to be
That God's own Son
Should come from heaven
And die to save a child like me

And yet I know that it is true
He came to this poor world below
And wept and toiled and mourned and died
Only because He loved us so

I cannot tell how He could love
A child so weak and full of sin
His love must be most wonderful
If He could die my love to win

But even could I see Him die
I could but see a little part
Of that great love which like a fire
Is always burning in His heart

How wonderful it is to know
His love for me so free and sure
But yet more wonderful to see
My love for Him so faint and poor

And yet I want to love You Lord
O teach me how to grow in grace
That I may love You more and more
Until I see You face to face

145 JERUSALEM

See Him in Jerusalem
Walking where the crowds are
Once these streets had sung to Him
Now they cry for murder
Such a frail and lonely Man
Holding up the heavy cross
See Him walking in Jerusalem
On the road to save us

See Him there upon the hill
Hear the scorn and laughter
Silent as a lamb He waits
Praying to the Father
See the King who made the sun
And the moon and shining stars
Let the soldiers hold and nail Him down
So that He could save them

See Him there upon the cross
Now no longer breathing
Dust that formed the watching crowds
Takes the blood of Jesus
Feel the earth is shaking now
See the veil is split in two
And He stood before the wrath of God
Shielding sinners with His blood

See the empty tomb today
Death could not contain Him
Once the Servant of the world
Now in vict'ry reigning
Lift your voices to the One
Who is seated on the throne
See Him in the New Jerusalem
Praise the One who saved us

146 JESUS I WILL TRUST THEE

Jesus I will trust thee
Trust thee with my soul
Guilty lost and helpless
Thou canst make me whole
There is none in heaven
Or on earth like thee
Thou hast died for sinners
Therefore Lord for me

Jesus I must trust thee
Pondering thy ways
Full of love and mercy
All thine earthly days
Sinners gathered round thee
Lepers sought thy face
None too vile or loathsome
For a Saviour's grace

Jesus I can trust thee
Trust thy written word
Though thy voice of pity
I have never heard
When thy spirit teacheth
To my taste how sweet
Only may I hearken
Sitting at thy feet

Jesus I do trust thee
Trust without a doubt
Whosoever cometh
Thou wilt not cast out
Faithful is thy promise
Precious is thy blood
These my soul's salvation
Thou my Saviour God

147 JESUS, LORD, WE KNOW THEE PRESENT

Jesus, Lord, we know Thee present
At Thy table freshly spread
Seated at Thy priceless banquet
With Thy banner overhead
Precious moments at Thy table
From all fear and doubt set free
Here to rest, so sweetly able
Occupied alone with Thee

Here rejoicing in Thy nearness
Gladly by Thy Spirit led
Calmly in the blest remembrance
Of Thyself, Thy blood once shed
Lord, we take each simple token
In fond memory of Thee
Muse upon Thy body broken
And Thy blood shed on the tree

Oh, what joy it is to see Thee
In these chosen emblems here
In the bread and wine of blessing
Bread to strengthen, wine to cheer
Lord, behold us met together
One in Thee, our risen Head
Thus we take the cup of blessing
Thus we share the broken bread

Lord, we know how true Thy promise
To be with us where we meet
When in Thy loved name we gather
To enjoy communion sweet
Dearer still that looked-for promise
To each waiting, yearning heart
That with Thee we soon shall be, Lord
Yes, "forever" where Thou art

148 JESUS THE VERY THOUGHT OF THEE

Jesus, the very thought of Thee
With sweetness fills my breast
But sweeter far Thy face to see
And in Thy presence rest

Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame
Nor can the memory find
A sweeter sound than Thy blest name
O Saviour of mankind!

O Hope of every contrite heart
O Joy of all the meek
To those who fall, how kind Thou art!
How good to those who seek!

But what to those who find?
Ah, this nor tongue nor pen can show
The love of Jesus, what it is
None but His loved ones know

Jesus, our only joy be Thou
As Thou our prize wilt be
Jesus, be Thou our Glory now
And thru eternity
Amen

149 JESUS THY BLOOD AND RIGHTEOUSNESS

Jesus thy blood and righteousness
My beauty are my glorious dress
Midst flaming worlds in these arrayed
With joy shall I lift up my head

Bold shall I stand in thy great day
For to my charge who aught shall lay
Fully absolved through these I am
From sin and fear from guilt and shame

Thus Abraham, the friend of God
Thus all the saints redeemed with blood
Saviour of sinners thee proclaim
And all their boast is in thy name

This spotless robe the same appears
When ruined nature sinks in years
No age can change its glorious hue
The robe of Christ is ever new

When from the dust of death I rise
To claim my mansion in the skies
E'en then this shall be all my plea
Jesus hath lived hath died for me

Oh let the dead now dear thy voice
Now bid thy banished ones rejoice
Their beauty this, their glorious dress
"Jesus, the Lord our righteousness."

150 JOY TO THE WORLD

Joy to the world the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let ev'ry heart prepare Him room
And heav'n and nature sing
And heav'n and nature sing
And heav'n and heav'n and nature sing

Joy to the earth the Saviour reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat repeat the sounding joy

No more let sins and sorrows grow
Nor thorns infest the ground
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found
Far as the curse is found
Far as far as the curse is found

He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders wonders of His love

151 JOYFUL JOYFUL WE ADORE THEE

Joyful joyful we adore Thee
God of glory Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flow’rs before Thee
Opening to the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us with the light of day

All Thy works with joy surround Thee
Earth and heav’n reflect Thy rays
Stars and angels sing around Thee
Center of unbroken praise
Field and forest vale and mountain
Flowery meadow flashing sea
Chanting bird and flowing fountain
Call us to rejoice in Thee

Thou art giving and forgiving
Ever blessing ever blest
Wellspring of the joy of living
Ocean depth of happy rest
Thou our Father Christ our Brother
All who live in love are Thine
Teach us how to love each other
Lift us to the joy divine

Mortals join the mighty chorus
Which the morning stars began
Father love is reigning o'er us
Brother love binds man to man
Ever singing march we onward
Victors in the midst of strife
Joyful music lifts us sunward
In the triumph song of life

152 LEAD ME TO THE CROSS

How can I be free from sin
Lead me to the cross of Jesus
From the guilt the pow'r the pain
Lead me to the cross of Jesus

There's no other way
No price that I could pay
Simply to the cross I cling
This is all I need
This is all I plead
That His blood was shed for me

How can I know peace within
Lead me to the cross of Jesus
Sing a song of joy again
Lead me to the cross of Jesus

Flowing from above
All-forgiving love
From the Father's heart to me
What a gift of grace
His own righteousness
Clothing me in purity

How can I live day by day
Lead me to the cross of Jesus
Following His narrow way
Lead me to the cross of Jesus

153 LET YOUR KINGDOM COME

Your glorious cause O God
Engages our hearts
May Jesus Christ be known
Wherever we are
We ask not for ourselves
But for Your renown
The cross has saved us so we pray
Your kingdom come

Let Your kingdom come
Let Your will be done
So that ev'ryone might know Your Name
Let Your song be heard ev'rywhere on earth
Till Your sov'reign work on earth is done
Let Your kingdom come

Give us Your strength O God
And courage to speak
Perform Your wondrous deeds
Through those who are weak
Lord use us as You want
Whatever the test
By grace we'll preach Your Gospel till
Our dying breath

154 LORD SPEAK TO ME

Lord speak to me that I may speak
In living echoes of Thy tone
As Thou hast sought so let me seek
Thy erring children lost and lone

O lead me Lord that I may lead
The wandering and the wavering feet
O feed me Lord that I may feed
Your hungering ones with manna sweet

O strengthen me that while I stand
Firm on the rock and strong in Thee
I may stretch out a loving hand
To wrestlers with the troubled sea

O teach me Lord that I may teach
The precious things Thou dost impart
And wing my words that they may reach
The hidden depths of many a heart

O give Thine own sweet rest to me
That I may speak with soothing power
A word in season as from Thee
To weary ones in needful hour

O fill me with Thy fulness Lord
Until my very heart o'erflow
In kindling thought and glowing word
Thy love to tell Thy praise to show

O use me Lord use even me
Just as Thou wilt and when and where
Until Thy blessed face I see
Thy rest Thy joy Thy glory share

155 LOVE OF GOD

Love of God revealed in wonder
By the works of a maker's hand
Seas that roar with thunderous splendour
Fields that whisper at His command
All the joys of life we cherish
Are God's gracious sign
We are children of His promise
Heirs of mercy and grace divine

Unfailing love from heaven's throne
That sought me out and brought me home
My song of praise shall ever be
The Father's love for me

Love of God revealed in frailty
Through the gift of a servant King
Joy of heaven robed in humility
Prince of Peace crowned with suffering
Oh what love that calls humanity
To kneel at the cross
And exchange our sin's futility
For the joy of a father's love

Love of God what priceless treasure
Over all this world affords
To be His and His forever
This my glory and my reward
May this love beyond all knowing
So capture my soul
That I'm filled to overflowing
With a passion for Him alone

156 LOVE WAS WHEN

Love was when God became a man
Locked in time and space without rank or place
Love was God born of Jewish kin
Just a carpenter with some fishermen
Love was when Jesus walked in history
Lovingly He brought a new life that's free
Love was God nailed to bleed and die
To reach and love one such as I

Love was when God became a man
Down where I could see love that reached to me
Love was God dying for my sin
And so trapped was I my whole world caved in
Love was when Jesus rose to walk with me
Lovingly He brought a new life that's free
Love was God only He would try
To reach and love one such as I
To love one such as I

157 LOW IN THE GRAVE HE LAY

Low in the grave He lay
Jesus my Saviour
Waiting the coming day
Jesus my Lord

Up from the grave He arose
As the victor over all His foes
He arose in triumph
From the dark domain
And He lives forever
With His saints to reign
He arose He arose
Alleluia Christ arose

Vainly they guard His bed
Jesus my Saviour
Vainly they seal the dead
Jesus my Lord

Death cannot keep his prey
Jesus my Saviour
He tore the bars away
Jesus my Lord

158 MIGHTY GOD WHILE ANGELS BLESS THEE

Mighty God while angels bless Thee
May a mortal sing Thy name
Lord of men as well as angels
Thou art every creature's theme
Lord of every land and nation
Ancient of eternal days
Sounded through the wide creation
Be Thy just and endless praise

For the grandeur of Thy nature
Grand beyond a seraph's thought
For the wonders of creation
Works with skill and kindness wrought
For Thy providence that governs
Through Thine empire's wide domain
Wings an angel guides a sparrow
Blessed be Thy gentle reign

But Thy rich Thy free redemption
Bright though veiled in darkness long
Thought is poor and poor expression
Who can sing that wondrous song
Brightness of the Father's glory
Shall Thy praise unuttered lie
Break my tongue such guilty silence
Sing the Lord who came to die

From the highest throne of glory
To the cross of deepest woe
Thou didst stoop to ransom captives
Flow my praise forever flow
Reascend immortal Saviour
Leave Thy footstool take Thy throne
Thence return and reign forever
Be the kingdom all Thine own

159 MY FAITH LOOKS UP TO THEE

My faith looks up to Thee
Thou Lamb of Calvary
Saviour divine
Now hear me while I pray
Take all my guilt away
O let me from this day
Be wholly Thine

May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart
My zeal inspire
As Thou hast died for me
O may my love to Thee
Pure warm and changeless be
A living fire

While life's dark maze I tread
And grief's around me spread
Be Thou my guide
Bid darkness turn to day
Wipe sorrow's tears away
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside

When ends life's transient dream
When death's cold sullen stream
Shall o'er me roll
Blest Saviour then in love
Fear and distrust remove
O bear me safe above
A ransomed soul

160 MY FATHER WATCHES OVER ME

I trust in God wherever I may be
Upon the land or on the rolling sea
For come what may from day to day
My heav'nly Father watches over me

I trust in God I know He cares for me
On mountain bleak or on the stormy sea
Tho' billows roll He keeps my soul
My heav'nly Father watches over me

He makes the rose an object of His care
He guides the eagle thru the pathless air
And surely He remembers me
My heav'nly Father watches over me

I trust in God for in the lion's den
On battlefield or in the prison pen
Thru praise or blame thru flood or flame
My heav'nly Father watches over me

The valley may be dark the shadows deep
But O the Shepherd guards His lonely sheep
And thru the gloom He'll lead me home
My heav'nly Father watches over me

161 NOW I BELONG TO JESUS

Jesus my Lord will love me forever
From Him no pow'r of evil can sever
He gave His life to ransom my soul
Now I belong to Him

Now I belong to Jesus
Jesus belongs to me
Not for the years of time alone
But for eternity

Once I was lost in sin's degradation
Jesus came down to bring me salvation
Lifted me up from sorrow and shame
Now I belong to Him

Joy floods my soul for Jesus has saved me
Freed me from sin that long had enslaved me
His precious blood He gave to redeem
Now I belong to Him

162 NOW THANK WE ALL OUR GOD

Now thank we all our God
With hearts and hands and voices
Who wondrous things has done
In whom His world rejoices
Who from our mother's arms
Has blessed us on our way
With countless gifts of love
And still is ours today

O may this bounteous God
Through all our life be near us
With ever joyful hearts
And blessed peace to cheer us
And keep us in His grace
And guide us when perplexed
And free us from all ills
In this world and the next

All praise and thanks to God
The Father now be given
The Son and Him who reigns
With them in highest heaven
The one eternal God
Whom earth and heaven adore
For thus it was is now
And shall be evermore

163 O BLESSED LORD, WHAT HAST THOU DONE

O blessed Lord, what hast Thou done!
How vast a ransom paid!
Who could conceive God's only Son
Upon the altar laid!

Thy Father, in His perfect love
Did spare Thee from His side
And Thou did stoop to bear above
At such a cost Thy bride

Lord, while our souls in faith repose
Upon Thy precious blood
Peace like an even river flows
And mercy like a flood

But boundless joy shall fill our hearts
When gazing on Thy face
We fully see what faith imparts
And glory crowns Thy grace

Unseen we love Thee, dear Thy name
But when our eyes behold
With joyful wonder we'll exclaim
The half hath not been told!

For Thou exceedest all the fame
Our ears have ever heard
Happy are they who know Thy name
And trust Thy faithful Word!

164 O CHURCH OF CHRIST INVINCIBLE

O Church of Christ invincible
The people of the Lord
Empowered by the Spirit's breath
And nourished by His word
His covenant of grace will be
Our portion evermore
For He who called us will not change
Our help and our reward

O chosen people called by grace
The sons of Abraham
Who walk by faith and things unseen
And on His promise stand
That ev'ry nation of the earth
Will hear about this love
That causes broken hearts to heal
And pays our debts with blood

O Church of Christ in sorrow now
Where evil lies in wait
When trials and persecutions come
This light will never fade
For though the hordes of hell may rage
Their pow'r will not endure
Our times are in the Father's hand
Our anchor is secure

O Church of Christ upon that day
When all are gathered in
When ev'ry tear is wiped away
With ev'ry trace of sin
Where justice truth and beauty shine
And death is passed away
Where God and man will dwell as one
For all eternity

165 O COME ALL YE FAITHFUL

O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of angels

O come let us adore Him

Hosts of heav'n above

Yea Lord we greet Thee
Born this happy morning
Jesus to Thee be all glory giv'n
Word of the Father
Now in flesh appearing

166 O COME ALL YOU UNFAITHFUL

O come all you unfaithful
Come weak and unstable
Come know you are not alone

O come barren and waiting ones
Weary of praying
Come see what your God has done

Christ is born Christ is born
Christ is born for you

O come bitter and broken
Come with fears unspoken
Come taste of His perfect love

O come guilty and hiding ones
There is no need to run
See what your God has done

He's the Lamb who was given slain for our pardon
His promise is peace for those who believe
He's the Lamb who was given slain for our pardon
His promise is peace for those who believe

So come though you have nothing
Come He is the offering
Come see what your God has done

167 O COME O COME EMMANUEL

O come O come Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear

Rejoice rejoice Emmanuel
Shall come to thee O Israel

O come Thou Dayspring come and cheer
Our spirits by Thine advent here
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And death's dark shadows put to flight

O come Thou Wisdom from on high
And order all things far and nigh
To us the path of knowledge show
And cause us in her ways to go

O come Desire of nations bind
All peoples in one heart and mind
Bid envy strife and quarrels cease
Fill the whole world with heaven's peace

168 O LORD MY ROCK AND MY REDEEMER

O Lord my Rock and my Redeemer
Greatest treasure of my longing soul
My God like You there is no other
True delight is found in You alone
Your grace a well too deep to fathom
Your love exceeds the heavens' reach
Your truth a fount of perfect wisdom
My highest good and my unending need

O Lord my Rock and my Redeemer
Strong defender of my weary heart
My sword to fight the cruel deceiver
And my shield against his hateful darts
My song when enemies surround me
My hope when tides of sorrow rise
My joy when trials are abounding
Your faithfulness my refuge in the night

O Lord my Rock and my Redeemer
Gracious Saviour of my ruined life
My guilt and cross laid on Your shoulders
In my place You suffered bled and died
You rose the grave and death are conquered
You broke my bonds of sin and shame
O Lord my Rock and my Redeemer
May all my days bring glory to Your Name

169 O MIGHTY CROSS

O mighty cross love lifted high
The Lord of life raised there to die
His sacrifice on Calvary
Has made the mighty cross a tree of life to me

O mighty cross what throne of grace
He knew no sin yet took my place
His sacrifice on Calvary
Has made the mighty cross a tree of life to me

O mighty cross O Christ so pure
Love held Him there such shame endured
His sacrifice on Calvary
Has made the mighty cross a tree of life to me

O mighty cross my soul's release
The stripes He bore have brought me peace
His sacrifice on Calvary
Has made the mighty cross a tree of life to me

170 O WORSHIP THE KING

O worship the King all-glorious above
O gratefully sing his power and his love
Our shield and defender, the Ancient of Days
Pavilioned in splendour and girded with praise

O tell of his might and sing of his grace
Whose robe is the light, whose canopy space
His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form
And dark is his path on the wings of the storm

Your bountiful care, what tongue can recite?
It breathes in the air, it shines in the light
It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain
And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain

Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail
In you do we trust, nor find you to fail
Your mercies, how tender, how firm to the end
Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend!

O measureless Might, unchangeable Love
Whom angels delight to worship above!
Your ransomed creation, with glory ablaze
In true adoration shall sing to your praise!

171 O FOR A CLOSER WALK WITH GOD

O for a closer walk with God,
A calm and heav'nly frame
A light to shine upon the road
That leads me to the Lamb!

Where is the blessedness I knew
When first I sought the Lord?
Where is the soul refreshing view
Of Jesus and His Word?

What peaceful hours I then enjoyed!
How sweet their mem'ry still!
But they have left an aching void
The world can never fill

The dearest idol I have known
Whate'er that idol be
Help me to tear it from Thy throne
And worship only Thee.

So shall my walk be close with God
Calm and serene my frame
So purer light shall mark the road
That leads me to the Lamb

172 O TEACH ME WHAT IT MEANETH

O teach me what it meaneth
That cross uplifted high
With One, the Man of Sorrows
Condemned to bleed and die!
O teach me what it cost Thee
To make a sinner whole
And teach me, Saviour, teach me
The value of a soul!

O teach me what it meaneth
That sacred crimson tide
The blood and water flowing
From Thine own wounded side
Teach me that if none other
Had sinned, but I alone
Yet still Thy blood, Lord Jesus
Thine only, must atone

O teach me what it meaneth
Thy love beyond compare
The love that reacheth deeper
Than depths of self-despair!
Yes, teach me, till there gloweth
In this cold heart of mine
Some feeble, pale reflection
Of that pure love of Thine

O teach me what it meaneth
For I am full of sin
And grace alone can reach me
And love alone can win
O teach me, for I need Thee
I have no hope beside -
The chief of all the sinners
For whom the Saviour died!

O infinite Redeemer!
I bring no other plea
Because Thou dost invite me
I cast myself on Thee
Because Thou dost accept me
I love and I adore
Because Thy love constraineth
I’ll praise Thee evermore!

173 ON THAT DAY

I believe in Christ, risen from the dead
He now reigns victorious, His kingdom knows no end
Through His resurrection death has lost its hold
I know on that final day I’ll rise as Jesus rose

On that day we will see you shining brighter than the sun
On that day we will know you as we lift our voice as one
Till that day we will praise you for your never ending grace
And we will keep on singing on that glorious day

What a blessed hope, though now tired and worn
We will spend eternity around our Saviour’s throne
Though we grieve our losses we grieve not in vain
For we know our crown of glory waits beyond the grave

Hallelujah what a day it will be
For at home with you my joy is complete
As I run into your arms open wide I will see
My father who is waiting for me

174 PROMISES

I can always call you father
You chose me as your child
And your word is always faithful
You will not turn aside
Now I live in full assurance
For my saviour paid that price
Every promise that you made me
Is yes in Jesus Christ

You are faithful to your promises
We will trust in what the cross has said
Through the ages hallelujah you are
Faithful to your promises

Are you with us in the fire
Will you keep us in the storm
Are you still the light that guides us
When the darkness overwhelms
Through the doubts and through the valleys
Through the passing years we find
Every promise you have spoken
Is yes in Jesus Christ

You will be our God
We will be your people
You will be with us
Keep us from all evil
Every promise made
Is a promise kept
You are faithful to your promises

You began this work within us
You will bring it to the end
You're the one who goes before us
You will have the last Amen
So we set our hope upon this
An on this we build our lives
All your promises forever
Are yes in Jesus Christ

175 PSALM 62

My soul finds rest in God alone
My rock and my salvation
A fortress strong against my foes
And I will not be shaken
Though lips may bless and hearts may curse
And lies like arrows pierce me
I'll fix my heart on righteousness
I'll look to Him who hears me

O praise Him hallelujah
My Delight and my Reward
Everlasting never failing
My Redeemer my God

Find rest my soul in God alone
Amid the world's temptations
When evil seeks to take a hold
I'll cling to my salvation
Though riches come and riches go
Don't set your heart upon them
The fields of hope in which I sow
Are harvested in heaven

I'll set my gaze on God alone
And trust in Him completely
With ev'ry day pour out my soul
And He will prove His mercy
Though life is but a fleeting breath
A sigh too brief to measure
My King has crushed the curse of death
And I am His forever

O praise Him O praise Him
Hallelujah hallelujah
O praise Him O praise Him
Hallelujah Hallelujah
O praise Him O praise Him
Hallelujah hallelujah

176 REJOICE THE LORD IS KING

Rejoice the Lord is King
Your Lord and King adore
Mortals give thanks and sing
And triumph evermore

Lift up your heart lift up your voice
Rejoice again I say rejoice

Jesus the Saviour reigns
The God of truth and love
When He had purged our stains
He took His seat above

His kingdom cannot fail
He rules o'er earth and heaven
The keys of death and hell
Are to our Jesus given

He sits at God's right hand
Till all His foes submit
And bow to His command
And fall beneath His feet

Rejoice in glorious hope
Jesus the Judge shall come
And take His servants up
To their eternal home

We soon shall hear the archangel's voice
The trump of God shall sound rejoice

177 SAVIOUR THY DYING LOVE

Saviour Thy dying love
Thou gavest me
Nor should I aught withhold
My Lord from Thee
In love My soul would bow
My heart fulfil it's vow
Some offering bring Thee now
Something for Thee

At the blest mercy seat
Pleading for me
My feeble faith looks up
Jesus to Thee
Help me the cross to bear
Thy wondrous love declare
Some song to raise or prayer
Something for Thee

Give me a faithful heart
Likeness to Thee
That each departing day
Henceforth may see
Some work of love begun
Some deed of kindness done
Some wanderer sought and won
Something for Thee

All that I am and have
Thy gifts so free
In joy in grief through life
O Lord for Thee
And when Thy Face I see
My ransomed soul shall be
Through all eternity
Something for Thee

178 SING WE THE KING

Sing we the King who is coming to reign
Glory to Jesus the Lamb that was slain
Life and salvation His empire shall bring
Joy to the nations when Jesus is King

Come let us sing praise to our King
Jesus our King Jesus our King
This is our song who to Jesus belong
Glory to Jesus to Jesus our King

All men shall dwell in his marvellous light
Races long severed his love shall unite
Justice and truth from his sceptre shall spring
Wrong shall be ended when Jesus is King

All shall be well in his Kingdom of peace
Freedom shall flourish and wisdom increase
Foe shall be friend when his triumph we sing
Sword shall be sickle when Jesus is King

Souls shall be saved from the burden of sin
Doubt shall not darken His witness within
Hell hath no terrors and death hath no sting
Love is victorious when Jesus is King

Kingdom of Christ for Thy coming we pray
Hasten O Father the dawn of the day
When this new song Thy creation shall sing
Satan is vanquished and Jesus is King

179 STILL MY SOUL BE STILL

Still my soul be still and do not fear
Though winds of change may rage tomorrow
God is at your side no longer dread
The fires of unexpected sorrow

God You are my God
And I will trust in You and not be shaken
Lord of peace renew
A steadfast spirit within me
To rest in You alone

Still my soul be still do not be moved
By lesser lights and fleeting shadows
Hold on to His ways with shield of faith
Against temptation's flaming arrows

Still my soul be still do not forsake
The truth you learned in the beginning
Wait upon the Lord and hope will rise
As stars appear when day is dimming

180 THE BOND OF LOVE

Love thru Christ has bro't us together
Melting our hearts as one
By God's Spirit we are united
One thru His blessed Son

We are one in the bond of love
We are one in the bond of love
We have joined our spirit
With the Spirit of God
We are one in the bond of love

Now dear Lord we join in worship
Thank You for all You've done
Thank You for this love You gave us
Thank You for making us one

Let us sing now ev'ryone
Let us feel His love begun
Let us join our hands
So the world will know
We are one in the bond of love

181 THE GOD OF ABRAHAM PRAISE

The God of Abraham praise
Who reigns enthroned above
Ancient of Everlasting Days
And God of Love
Jehovah, great I AM!
By earth and heaven confessed
I bow and bless the sacred name
Forever blest

The God of Abraham praise
At whose supreme command
From earth I rise and seek the joys
At his right hand
I all on earth forsake
Its wisdom, fame and power
And him my only portion make
My shield and tower

The God of Abraham praise
Whose all-sufficient grace
Shall guide me all my happy days
In all my ways
He calls a worm his friend
He calls himself my God
And he shall save me to the end
Through Jesus' blood

He by himself hath sworn
I on his oath depend
I shall on eagle's wings upborne
To heaven ascend
I shall behold his face
I shall his power adore
And sing the wonders of his grace
For evermore

The whole triumphant host
Give thanks to God on high
"Hail, Father, Son and Holy Ghost!"
They ever cry
Hail, Abraham's God and mine!
I join the heavenly lays
All might and majesty and thine
And endless praise

182 THE LOVE THAT JESUS HAD FOR ME

The love that Jesus had for me
To suffer on the cruel tree
That I a ransomed soul might be
Is more than tongue can tell

His love is more than tongue can tell
His love is more than tongue can tell
The love that Jesus had for me
Is more than tongue can tell

The many sorrows that He bore
And oh, that crown of thorns He wore
That I might live forevermore
Is more than tongue can tell

The peace I have in Him, my Lord
Who pleads before the throne of God
The merit of His precious blood
Is more than tongue can tell

The joy that comes when He is near
The rest He gives, so free from fear
The hope in Him so bright and clear
Is more than tongue can tell

183 THE OLD RUGGED CROSS

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross
The emblem of suff'ring and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross
Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

O the old rugged cross so despised by the world
Has a wondrous attraction for me
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary

In the old rugged cross stained with blood so divine
A wondrous beauty I see
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sanctify me

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true
Its shame and reproach gladly bear
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away
Where His glory forever I'll share

184 THERE IS A GREEN HILL FAR AWAY

There is a green hill far away
Outside a city wall
Where the dear Lord was crucified
Who died to save us all

We may not know we cannot tell
What pains He had to bear
But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffered there

He died that we might be forgiv'n
He died to make us good
That we might go at last to heav'n
Saved by His precious blood

There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin
He only could unlock the gate
Of heav'n and let us in

O dearly dearly has He loved
And we must love Him too
And trust in His redeeming blood
And try His works to do

185 THERE'S A WORK FOR JESUS

There's a work for Jesus, ready at your hand
'Tis a task the Master just for you has planned
Haste to do His bidding, yield Him service true
There's a work for Jesus none but you can do

Work for Jesus, day by day
Serve Him ever, falter never; Christ obey
Yield Him service loyal, true
There's a work for Jesus none but you can do

There's a work for Jesus, humble though it be
'Tis the very service He would ask of thee
Go where fields are whitened, and the lab'rers few
There's a work for Jesus none but you can do

There's a work for Jesus, precious souls to bring
Tell them of His mercies, tell them of your King
Faint not, nor grow weary, He will strength renew
There's a work for Jesus none but you can do

186 THERE IS ONE GOSPEL

There is one Gospel on which I stand
For all eternity
It is my story my Father's plan
The Son has rescued me
Oh what a Gospel oh what a peace
My highest joy and my deepest need
Now and forever He is my light
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

There is one Gospel to which I cling
All else I count as loss
For there where justice and mercy meet
He saved me on the cross
No more I boast in what I can bring
No more I carry the weight of sin
For He has brought me from death to life
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

There is one Gospel where hope is found
The empty tomb still speaks
For death could not keep my Saviour down
He lives and I am free
Now on my Saviour I fix my eyes
My life is His and His hope is mine
For he has promised I too will rise
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

And in this Gospel the church is one
We do not walk alone
We have His Spirit as we press on
To lead us safely home
And when in glory still I will sing
Of this old story that rescued me
Praise to my Saviour the King of life
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

187 THERE BLOOMS A ROSE IN BETHLEHEM

There blooms a rose in Bethlehem
From tender stem hath sprung
Of Jesse's line this flower grows
As men of old have sung
Isaiah told us long ago
About this rose we'd find
In virgin arms we shall behold
The Saviour of mankind

The glories of the heavens
Surrounded shepherds bright
The angels sang a sign was shown
The Christ was born that night
What mystery they came upon
The sign the heralds laud
In manger slept the Holy One
In flesh the Son of God

This flow'r in bloom a scent so sweet
That greets us in the air
It has dispelled with hopefulness
The sting of death's despair
Foretold this rose was born to die
But would not see decay
So those who place their faith in Him
Shall blossom from the grave

188 THINE BE THE GLORY

Thine be the glory, risen, conquering Son
Endless is the victory thou o'er death hast won
Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away
Kept the folded grave-clothes where thy body lay

Thine be the glory, risen, conquering Son
Endless is the victory thou o'er death hast won

Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb
Lovingly he greets us, scatters fear and gloom
Let the Church with gladness hymns of triumph sing
For her Lord now liveth; death hath lost its sting

No more we doubt thee, glorious Prince of life
Life is nought without thee: aid us in our strife
Make us more than conquerors, through thy deathless love
Bring us safe through Jordan to thy home above

189 THIS IS MY FATHER'S WORLD

This is my Father's world
And to my listening ears
All nature sings and round me rings
The music of the spheres
This is my Father's world
I rest me in the thought
Of rocks and trees of skies and seas
His hand the wonders wrought

This is my Father's world
The birds their carols raise
The morning light the lily white
Declare their Maker's praise
This is my Father's world
He shines in all that's fair
In the rustling grass I hear Him pass
He speaks to me everywhere

This is my Father's world
O let me ne'er forget
That though the wrong seems oft so strong
God is the Ruler yet
This is my Father's world
The battle is not done
Jesus who died shall be satisfied
And earth and heaven be one

190 THOU DIDST LEAVE THY THRONE

Thou didst leave Thy throne
And Thy kingly crown
When Thou camest to earth for me
But in Bethlehem's home
There was found no room
For Thy holy nativity
O come to my heart Lord Jesus
There is room in my heart for Thee

Heaven's arches rang when the angels sang
Proclaiming Thy royal degree
But of lowly birth cam'st Thou Lord on earth
And in great humility
O come to my heart Lord Jesus
There is room in my heart for Thee

The foxes found rest
And the birds had their next
In the shade of the cedar tree
But Thy couch was the sod
O Thou Son of God
In the deserts of Galilee
O come to my heart Lord Jesus
There is room in my heart for Thee

Thou camest O Lord with the living word
That should set Thy children free
But with mocking scorn
And with crown of thorn
They bore Thee to Calvary
O come to my heart Lord Jesus
Thy cross is my only plea

191 TO CALVARY, LORD, IN SPIRIT NOW

To Calvary, Lord, in spirit now
Our weary souls repair
To dwell upon Thy dying love
And taste its sweetness there

Sweet resting place of every heart
That feels the plague of sin
Yet knows that deep mysterious joy
The peace with God, within

There, through Thine hour of deepest woe
Thy suffering spirit passed
Grace there its wondrous victory gained
And love endured its last

Dear suffering Lamb! Thy bleeding wounds
With cords of love divine
Have drawn our willing hearts to Thee
And linked our life with Thine

Thy sympathies and hopes are ours
Dear Lord! we wait to see
Creation, all below, above
Redeemed and blest by Thee

Our longing eyes would fain behold
That bright and blessed brow
Once wrung with bitterest anguish, wear
Its crown of glory now

192 WE HAVE NOT KNOWN THEE AS WE OUGHT

We have not known thee as we ought
Nor learned thy wisdom, grace and pow'r
The things of earth have filled our thought
And trifles of the passing hour
Lord, give us light thy truth to see
And make us wise in knowing thee

We have not feared thee as we ought
Nor bowed beneath thine awesome eye
Nor guarded deed and word and thought
Remembering that God was nigh
Lord, give us faith to know thee near
And grant the grace of holy fear

We have not loved thee as we ought
Nor cared that we are loved by thee
Thy presence we have coldly sought
And feebly longed thy face to see
Lord, give a pure and loving heart
To feel and own the love thou art

We have not served thee as we ought
Alas! the duties left undone
The work with little fervor wrought
The battles lost or scarcely won!
Lord, give the zeal and give the might
For thee to toil, for thee to fight

When shall we know thee as we ought
And fear and love and serve aright!
When shall we, out of trial brought
Be perfect in the land of light!
Lord, may we day by day prepare
To see thy face and serve thee there

193 WE REST ON THEE

We rest on thee, our Shield and our Defender!
We go not forth alone against the foe
Strong in thy strength, safe in thy keeping tender
We rest on thee, and in thy name we go
Strong in thy strength, safe in thy keeping tender
We rest on thee, and in thy name we go

Yea, in thy name, O Captain of salvation!
In thy dear name, all other names above
Jesus our righteousness, our sure foundation
Our Prince of glory and our King of love
Jesus our righteousness, our sure foundation
Our Prince of glory and our King of love

We go in faith, our own great weakness feeling
And needing more each day thy grace to know
Yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing
"We rest on thee, and in thy name we go"
yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing
"We rest on thee, and in thy name we go."

We rest on thee, our Shield and our Defender!
Thine is the battle, thine shall be the praise
When passing through the gates of pearly splendour
Victors, we rest with thee, through endless days
When passing through the gates of pearly splendour
Victors, we rest with thee, through endless days

194 WHAT WAS IT, O OUR GOD

What was it, O our God
Led Thee to give Thy Son
To yield Thy Well-beloved
For us by sin undone?
‘Twas love unbounded led Thee thus
To give Thy Well-beloved for us

What led the Son of God
To leave His throne on high
To shed His precious blood
To suffer and to die?
‘Twas love, unbounded love to us
Led Him to die and suffer thus

What moved Thee to impart
Thy Spirit from above
That He might fill our heart
With heavenly peace and love?
‘Twas love, unbounded love to us
Moved Thee to give Thy Spirit thus

What love to Thee we owe
Our God, for all Thy grace!
Our hearts may well o’erflow
In everlasting praise
Help us, O Lord, to praise Thee thus
For all Thy boundless love to us

195 WHERE O GRAVE IS YOUR VICTORY

Through all life's sorrows and despairs
I will not be moved
When facing death I need not fear
I have this hope secure:

Because Christ died at Calvary
Sin has on me no claim
Because He overcame the grave
With Him I will be raised

Where, O grave, is your victory?
Where, O death, is your sting?
Eternity is won for me
By heaven's eternal King

On that glorious final day
I will not sleep or fade
But gazing on His nail pierced hands
I'll instantly be changed

Robed with immortality
Before His throne we'll sing
At last reflecting perfectly
The glory of our King
