5 JERUSALEM

Verse 1
See Him in Jerusalem
Walking where the crowds are
Once these streets had sung to Him
Now they cry for murder
Such a frail and lonely Man
Holding up the heavy cross
See Him walking in Jerusalem
On the road to save us

Verse 2
See Him there upon the hill
Hear the scorn and laughter
Silent as a lamb He waits
Praying to the Father
See the King who made the sun
And the moon and shining stars
Let the soldiers hold and nail Him down
So that He could save them

Verse 3
See Him there upon the cross
Now no longer breathing
Dust that formed the watching crowds
Takes the blood of Jesus
Feel the earth is shaking now
See the veil is split in two
And He stood before the wrath of God
Shielding sinners with His blood

Verse 4
See the empty tomb today
Death could not contain Him
Once the Servant of the world
Now in vict'ry reigning
Lift your voices to the One
Who is seated on the throne
See Him in the New Jerusalem
Praise the One who saved us
Praise the One who saved us!

Living hope that won't spoil or fade

Let us serve and exalt our King
With our hearts and our minds freely offer up our lives
Run the race fix our gaze on Him

Every tear will be wiped away
And the saints will be heard, praising God forevermore

Held in chains by the enemy
But You broke them in victory

You gave to me the breath of life
You brought me up out from the grave
I'm bursting out with songs of praise

Who else commands all the hosts of heaven
Who else could make every king bow down
Who else can whisper and darkness trembles

What other splendour outshines the sun
What other majesty rules with justice
Only a Holy God

Come and behold Him
The One and the Only
Cry out, sing holy
Forever a Holy God
Come and worship the Holy God

What other glory consumes like fire
What other power can raise the dead
What other name remains undefeated

Who else could rescue me from my failing
Who else would offer His only Son
Who else invites me to call Him Father
Only a Holy God
Only my Holy God!

13 CHRIST IS MINE FOREVERMORE

Mine are days that God has numbered
I was made to walk with Him
Yet I look for worldly treasure
And forsake the King of kings

But mine is hope in my Redeemer
Though I fall, his love is sure
For Christ has paid for every failing
I am His forevermore

Mine are tears in times of sorrow
Darkness not yet understood
Through the valley I must travel
Where I see no earthly good

But mine is peace that flows from heaven
And the strength in times of need
I know my pain will not be wasted
Christ completes his work in me

Mine are days here as a stranger
Pilgrim on a narrow way
One with Christ I will encounter
Harm and hatred for his name

But mine is armour for this battle
Strong enough to last the war
And he has said he will deliver
Safely to the golden shore

And mine are keys to Zion city
Where beside the King I walk
For there my heart has found its treasure
Christ is mine forevermore

Come rejoice now, O my soul
For his love is my reward
Fear is gone and hope is sure
Christ is mine forevermore!


14 BLESSED ASSURANCE

All my attempts to be satisfied
Were vain and empty
Until the moment you rescued me
And your love filled me

My soul sings
Now my soul sings

What blessed assurance
I've found in you
I've found in you
I won't be shaken I will not be moved

How steadfast your strong hand
Is keeping me
Is keeping me
I won't be shaken I will not be moved
Oh blessed assurance

No other love that I've ever known
Compares to you God
No other love that I've ever found
Has done what you've done

Ever my anchor
Ever my strength
Ever my portion
And all I need
Ever my healing
Ever my hope
Ever the truth that leads me home
That leads me home

15 GOOD AND GRACIOUS KING

I approach the throne of glory
Nothing in my hands I bring
But the promise of acceptance
From a good and gracious King

I will give to You my burden
As You give to me Your strength
Come and fill me with Your Spirit
As I sing to You this praise

You deserve the greater glory
Overcome, I lift my voice
To the King in need of nothing
Empty handed I rejoice

You deserve the greater glory
Overcome with joy I sing
By Your love I am accepted
You're a good and gracious King

O what grace that You would see me
As Your child and as Your friend
Safe, secure in You forever
I pour out my praise again

Holy, holy, Lord Almighty
Good and gracious
Good and gracious
Holy, holy, Lord Almighty
Good and gracious King

16 ALL MY WAYS ARE KNOWN TO YOU

In days of peace and days of rest

In times of loss and loneliness
Though rich or poor, Your word is true
That all my ways are known to You
No trial has come beyond Your hand
No step I walk beyond Your plan
The path is dark outside my view
Still all my ways are known to You
And oh what peace that I have found
Wherever I may be
For all my ways are known to You
Hallelujah, they are known to You!
I do not fear the final night

For death will be the door to life
You take my hand and lead me through
For all my ways are known to You
Open up my eyes so I may see
That You have made these ways for me
Open up my eyes so I may see
That You my God, will walk with me

17 I WANT TO KNOW YOU

I've tried in vain a thousand ways
My fears to quell, my hopes to raise
But what I need, Your word has said
Is ever, only, Jesus

You died, you live, you reign, you plead
There's love in all your words and deeds
This weary heart finds all it needs
In ever, only, Jesus

I want to know you, Jesus my Lord
King of the Heavens, King of my soul
I trade my treasure and all my rewards
Jesus to know you, then know you more

Though some should curse me for your name
I have no fear, I have no shame
You stand with me for all my days
My ever, only, Jesus

Like wave after wave on the ocean
Like all of the sand on the shore
Your beauty and glory are endless
O Jesus I must know you more

18 WHAT LOVE, MY GOD

What love my God would bring you down to earth
What king would take a low and lonely birth
Yet to this dark and broken place you came
To sleep beneath the stars that you had made

What love my God would send the Way of Life
To walk the road, rejected and despised
That you might know the weakness I possess
And be my rock of strength and righteousness

O Your love my God like a flood
As heaven opened up pouring out on us
O praise the King who came to the world
In his love like a mighty flood

What love my God could hold you to the tree
To bear that overwhelming debt for me
The Son of heaven leaves the Father's side
The Healer bleeds, the Life was made to die

What love my God, so gracious and extreme
Was strong enough to come and fight for me
To go through hell and down into the grave
And raise me up to see you face to face

You raise me up to see you face to face

19 SHEPHERD

Though I walk through the valley
And I can't see the way
When the shadows surround me
I will not be afraid

For I know You are with me
You will always provide
Though the path may be lonely
You will stay by my side
I will rest my soul
I'll trust in You alone

For the Lord my Shepherd
Leads me, leads me


And He is all I need
In the darkest valley
I know, I know
My Shepherd is all I need

Lord I know that You seek me
When I'm trying to hide
And Your love it pursues me
All the days of my life
I will rest my soul
I'll trust in You alone

I rest my soul
In You alone
You light my way
You lead me on

20 GRACE

Your grace that leads this sinner home
From death to life forever
And sings the song of righteousness
By blood and not by merit

Your grace that reaches far and wide
To every tribe and nation
Has called my heart to enter in
The joy of Your salvation

By grace I am redeemed
By grace I am restored
And now I freely walk
Into the arms of Christ my Lord

Not by my earthly wisdom
The prince of life, without a stain
Was traded for this sinner

Let praise rise up and overflow
My song resound forever
For grace will see me welcomed home
To walk beside my Saviour

All my pain and my sorrow You held 
So to you I shall hold 
You redeem every loss 
For my Lord, you have given yourself

Chorus 3
Bless the Lord! For he gives me Himself 
Bless the Lord! For he gives me Himself 
And if I should remain in the valley today 
Bless the Lord! For He gives me Himself 
Bless the Lord! For He gives me Himself

32 THERE IS ONE GOSPEL

Verse 1
There is one Gospel on which I stand
For all eternity
It is my story, my Father's plan
The Son has rescued me
Oh what a Gospel, Oh what a peace
My highest joy and my deepest need
Now and forever He is my light
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

Verse 2
There is one Gospel to which I cling
All else I count as loss
For there, where justice and mercy meet
He saved me on the cross
No more I boast in what I can bring
No more I carry the weight of sin
For He has brought me from death to life
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

Verse 3
There is one Gospel where hope is found
The empty tomb still speaks
For death could not keep my Saviour down
He lives and I am free
Now on my Saviour, I fix my eyes
My life is His and His hope is mine!
For He has promised I, too, will rise
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

Verse 4
And in this Gospel the church is one
We do not walk alone
We have His Spirit as we press on
To lead us safely home
And when in glory still I will sing
Of this old story that rescued me
Praise to my Saviour, the King of life
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

33 ON THAT DAY

Verse 1
I believe in Christ, risen from the dead
He now reigns victorious, His kingdom knows no end
Through His resurrection death has lost its hold
I know on that final day I'll rise as Jesus rose

Chorus
On that day we will see you shining brighter than the sun
On that day we will know you as we lift our voice as one
Till that day we will praise you for your never ending grace
And we will keep on singing on that glorious day

Verse 2
What a blessed hope, though now tired and worn
We will spend eternity around our Saviour's throne
Though we grieve our losses we grieve not in vain
For we know our crown of glory waits beyond the grave

Bridge
Hallelujah what a day it will be
For at home with you my joy is complete
As I run into your arms open wide I will see
My father who is waiting for me

34 PSALM 42 (I WILL PRAISE HIM AGAIN)

Why, my soul, are you downcast?
Why are you troubled within?
For I will hope in my Saviour, my God
And will praise Him, yet praise Him again

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
I will praise Him yet praise Him again

Morning by morning, new mercies are streaming
I trust in your goodness where I cannot see
You have been faithful whenever I wandered
Lord, give me the hope that I need

Chorus
This is the day that the Lord has made
We will rejoice as we lift His name
This is the day that the Lord has made
Come and rejoice, we will rejoice and be glad in it

And this is the day you made
Whether in life or death
Whether in joy or pain
I know this truth remains
That this is the day You made

Now I can walk in faith
You will protect my way
Your every work is good

God you were there from my beginning
For I was crafted by your hands
You see my hopes and hesitations
My days are written in your plan

If you have seen my weakest moments
And still you love me even then
I need no greater confirmation

No need for hiding, here in His light

As in Heaven, so on earth

Held by Your same unchanging love
Be still my soul
Oh, lift your voice and pray
Father not my will but Yours be done

I may never fully know
The fearful weight of true obedience
It was held by him alone

To bear my sin, what wondrous love

When there my Saviour prayed
Father not my will but Yours be done

When I am lost, when I am broken
In the night of fear and doubt
Still I will trust in my good Father
Yes, to one great King I bow!

In ransomed glory at the throne
My heart restored
With all your saints I sing
Father, not my will but Yours be done

Verse 4
As we go forth, our God and Father
Lead us daily in the fight
That all the world might see Your glory
And Your Name be lifted high

Chorus
And in this Name we overcome
For You shall see us safely home
Now as your church
We lift our voice and pray
Father, not my will but Yours be done

46 HIS GLORY & MY GOOD

Verse 1
I have seen my Father's glory
Revealed in Jesus Christ
And the more that I behold Him
The more He satisfies

When I gaze upon His beauty
When I see Him as I should
Then my eyes are lifted upward
For His glory and my good

Verse 2
There is hope in every trial
For I can trust the Lord
He will turn my heart towards Him
And help me bear the thorn

So in faith I follow Jesus
On the road not understood
For I know that He is working
For His glory and my good

Chorus
To our God be the glory
To our God be praise
He alone, the name above all names

I will boast ever only in the Lord my God
For I know
His glory is my good

Verse 3
See the open arms of Jesus
Upon the cross that day
What they understood as weakness
Deserves my every praise

For the charge that was against me
It was nailed into the wood
Yes I know that He has saved me
For His glory and my good

Verse 4
Would I gladly be made nothing
That Christ would be made more
Would I seek the only kingdom
That far outweighs them all

I will stand before my Father
Where the faithful saints have stood
And with joy my heart shall praise Him
For His glory and my good
