10 O GOD BEYOND ALL PRAISING

O God beyond all praising,
we worship you today
and sing the love amazing
that songs cannot repay;
for we can only wonder
at every gift you send,
at blessings without number
and mercies without end:
we lift our hearts before you
and wait upon your word,
we honour and adore you,
our great and mighty Lord.

The flower of earthly splendor
in time must surely die,
its fragile bloom surrender
to you the Lord most high;
but hidden from all nature
the eternal seed is sown -
though small in mortal stature,
to heaven's garden grown:
for Christ the Man from heaven
from death has set us free,
and we through him are given
the final victory!

Then hear, O gracious Saviour,
accept the love we bring,
that we who know your favour
may serve you as our king;
and whether our tomorrows
be filled with good or ill,
we'll triumph through our sorrows
and rise to bless you still:
to marvel at your beauty
and glory in your ways,
and make a joyful duty
our sacrifice of praise.

12 MY HEART, YOUR BETHLEHEM

Will You have a place to lay Your head
on the night of Your holy birth?
A crown or a robe of royal thread
as Your life begins on earth?
Though some will not receive You,
or know just who You are,
I will prepare a place for You:
a home within my heart.

I'll make my heart Your Bethlehem,
where You O Lord, can enter in;
Shine Your light, let Your life in me begin;
and make my heart Your Bethlehem.

O Holy Child of Bethlehem,
descend to us we pray;
Cast out our sin and enter in,
be born in us today!
Though some will not believe
You are the Saviour born for them,
I will prepare a place for you:
my heart, Your Bethlehem.

How silently, how silently
the wondrous gift is giv'n!
So God imparts to human hearts
the blessings of His heav'n.
Though some will not receive You,
or know just who You are,
I will prepare a place for You,
a home within my heart.

I'll make my heart Your Bethlehem,
where You O Lord, can enter in;
Shine Your light, let Your life in me begin;
and make my heart Your Bethlehem;
and make my heart Your Bethlehem.

13 RING THE BELLS

Ring the bells, ring the bells,
Let the whole world know
Christ was born in Bethlehem
Many years ago.

Born to die that man might live,
came to earth new life to give,
Born of Mary, born so low,
Many years ago.

God the Father gave His Son,
Gave His own Beloved One
To this wicked, sinful earth.
To bring mankind His love, new birth:

Ring the bells, ring the bells,
Let the whole world know
Christ the Savior lives today
as He did so long ago.

21 CREATOR GOD

Creator God, who shaped the earth and heavens
Your glory shines in all that you have made
You spoke the Word, who broke into the darkness
All earth replies: "majestic is your name!"

And who am I, though made below the angels
That you, my King, are mindful of my ways?
As moon and stars sing out their joyful chorus
I lift my voice to join with them in praise

Redeeming God, creation's song fell silent
As on the cross, the Light was pierced with dark
The Word of life to death now hangs surrendered
The one who spoke out stars now breathes his last

And who am I, the lowliest of sinners
That you would pay the price my sin deserves?
My Maker scarred for those who marred his likeness
And from his wounds flows mercy unreserved

O living God! You broke the tomb in glory
Death could not hold the one who authored life!
His radiant light has shattered through our darkness
And in our hearts, his risen life now shines

And who are we, that you would call us children
And raise us up from death to life with you
Where we will sing the New Creation anthem:
"O praise the one who's making all things new!"

And so we wait in eager expectation
And join the song as all creation groans:
"Lord, haste the Day decay is slain by glory,
The Day you call your sons and daughters home."
