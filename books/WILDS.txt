1 SERVANT'S HEART

Make me a servant like you, dear Lord,
Living for others each day.
Humble and meek, helping the weak,
Loving in all that I say.

Chorus:
Give me, Lord, a servant's heart.
Here's my life; take ev'ry part.
Give me, Lord, a servant's heart.
Help me draw so close to You
That your love comes shining through.
Give me, Lord, a servant's heart.
Give me, Lord, a servant's heart.

Make me a witness like You, dear Lord,
Showing the love of the cross,
Sharing your Word till all have heard,
Serving whatever the cost.

2 AS WE READ YOUR HOLY WORD

As we read Your Holy Word,
Help us see, Lord, help us learn;
Holy Spirit, from its pages lead the way.
Come and melt our stubborn will;
Make our hearts and souls be still.
As we read Your Word, May we heed it and obey.

Like the first rays of morning light,
It will pierce my darkest night,
Showing sins of doubt and fear within my heart (within my heart),
Showing self-confidence and pride,
The rebel thoughts that plague my mind.
Then it brings cleansing hope
That quiets my heart.

As we read Your Holy Word,
Help us see, Lord, help us learn;
Holy Spirit, from its pages lead the way.
Come and melt our stubborn will;
Make our hearts and souls be still.
As we read Your Word, May we heed it and obey.

Open my eyes and let me see
Glimpses of the truth You have for me.
For in Your Word I find
The truth that sets me free.

3 FROM HEAVEN'S HOLY THRONE

He stepped from heaven's holy throne
To take a body like our own.
With love so great, in manner meek,
For sinners Jesus came to seek.

Chorus:
On bended knee we bow to You-
Redeemer, Savior, Lord, and King!
Now grant to us, Lord Jesus Christ,
Thankful lives and humbled hearts.

Christ lived a humble, blameless life,
Yet men in hatred caused Him strife.
Among the thieves they nailed Him high,
Though we deserved that death to die.

When Jesus died, a darkness fell,
As if creation could not tell
If it would ever once more shine
The glories of the King divine.

Then Christ arose just as He said:
He crushed our sin and Satan's head.
The light of Jesus' empty grave,
Proves Christ our Savior came to save!

No more a servant, now a King-
He rules now over everything.
Robed in His garments free from stains,
We worship Him who ever reigns.

4 ALMIGHTY FATHER

Almighty Father, You alone are holy.
You are my refuge, I will trust in You.
You are a tower, a mighty fortress.
You are my strength and shield, You are God.

Almighty Father, You alone are holy.
You guide my footsteps that I may not fall.
In joy or sorrow, I will exalt You.
You are my righteousness, You are God.

Almighty Father, You alone are holy.
You are Creator, You are all in all!
Yours is the power, Yours is the glory.
Yours is the majesty, You are God.

5 HOW GREAT THOU ART

O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made,
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed.

Chorus:
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee;
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee;
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

When through the woods and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze,

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in -
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin!

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!

6 ALL I NEED

Jesus Christ is made to me,
All I need, all I need,
He alone is all my plea,
He is all I need.

Chorus:
Wisdom righteousness and pow'r,
Holiness forevermore,
My redemption full and sure,
He is all I need.

Jesus is my all in all,
All I need, all I need,
While He keeps I cannot fall,
He is all I need.

He redeemed me when He died,
All I need, all I need,
I with Him was crucified,
He is all I need.

He's the treasure of my soul,
All I need, all I need,
He hath cleansed and made me whole,
He is all I need.

Glory, glory to the Lamb,
All I need, all I need,
By His Spirit sealed I am,
He is all I need.

7 BLESSED BE THE NAME

All praise to Him who reigns above
In majesty supreme,
Who gave His Son for man to die,
That He might man redeem!

Chorus:
Blessed be the name, blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord;
Blessed be the name, blessed be the name,
Blessed be the name of the Lord.

His name above all names shall stand,
Exalted more and more,
At God the Father's own right hand,
Where angel hosts adore.

Redeemer, Saviour, Friend of man
Once ruined by the fall,
Thou hast devised salvation's plan,
For Thou hast died for all.

His name shall be the Counsellor,
The mighty Prince of Peace,
Of all earth's kingdoms Conqueror,
Whose reign shall never cease.

8 GOD'S WORD SHALL STAND FOREVER

Chorus:
God's Word shall stand forever,
The Bible shall prevail;
God's Word shall stand forever,
His truth can never, never fail.

For feelings come and feelings go,
And feelings are deceiving;
My warrant is the Word of God,
Naught else is worth believing.

Though' all my heart should feel condemned
For want of some sweet token,
There is One greater than my heart
Whose Word cannot be broken.

I'll trust in God's unchanging Word
Till soul and body sever:
For though' all things shall pass away,
His Word shall stand forever.

But then He came and lifted me!
By His grace I am set free!

11 LORD, YOU'RE ALL I NEED

Oft times I've tried to live my life according to my will.
When darkness comes it's difficult to rest and just be still.
But Lord, You are my shepherd who guides me in the way,
And I will learn this glorious truth If I Your Word obey.

Chorus:
You're all I need, You're the Lord of everything.
All I need, this is why I humbly sing.
Your strength is sustaining, and your grace has made me free.
You're my heart's lone desire, You're all I need.

By wanting more, I've wanted less than all You've given me.
You gave your all by laying down your life on Calvary.
So I surrender all, Lord, my best to You I give,
And thank you now for giving me a reason to live.

12 BE MERCIFUL, O GOD, TO ME (PSALM 57)

Be merciful, O God, to me!
My soul is weary and oppressed.
My foes are mighty, but I flee
To shelter in Your wings of rest,
To shelter in Your wings of rest.

Send out Your steadfast love to me
And all Your grace and faithfulness.
Your presence with me now shall be
My only joy and righteousness,
My only joy and righteousness.

My heart is steadfast all my days:
You are my song and melody!
Awake my soul, to sing His praise,
And, like the dawn, His glory see,
And, like the dawn, His glory see.

I give You praise among the just
And join the nations' happy song.
Let all Your glory spring to us-
We'll praise You here with ev'ry tongue,
We'll praise You here with ev'ry tongue.

Be e'er exalted, O my God!
Let all Your glory fill the earth!
Each mountain, plain, and sea abroad
Will know Your splendor, pow'r, and worth,
Will know Your splendor, pow'r and worth!

Jesus, Your death left hell's pow'r undone.
Pardon sin, reign within.
Jesus, show me gospel grace has won.

Jesus, Your Word is a living weapon.
Jesus, Your Truth slays the lies of men.
Pierce this heart, heal each part.
Jesus, break me to rejoice again.

Jesus, Your church stands adored in Your eyes,
Jesus, Your love for her cost Your life.
Help me view her as You.
Jesus, through me love your chosen bride.

14 COME AND SEE

Come see how Christ was crucified:
His bleeding head, His wounded side,
His broken body lifted up
To drink alone the bitter cup.

Come see Creation grieve the loss
Of God's own Son upon the Cross,
And see how darkness filled the skies
When death held captive Heaven's Prize.

Lord of Love, Lord of Life.
Lamb of God, our Sacrifice.
Come, and see the sacred Light:
Our Savior, Jesus Christ.

Come see our Lord's apparent tomb
As mourners placed Him in the tomb.
Yet on that third triumphant day,
The angel rolled the stone away!

Come see the work of Christ complete,
And fall before His Mercy Seat.
For you, His precious blood was spilled
To wash away all sin and guilt.

Lord of Love, Lord of Life.
Lamb of God, our Sacrifice.
Come, and see the sacred Light:
Our Savior, Jesus Christ.

Lord of Love, Lord of Life.
Lamb of God, our Sacrifice.
Come, and see the sacred Light:
Our Savior, Jesus Christ.
Our Savior, Jesus Christ!

15 ABOVE EVERY NAME

In the beginning, He was the Word,
Creator of all He became;
Hope of the nations, Prophet to come,
Immanuel, Jesus His name!

Chorus:
He is Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father above,
The Immortal, Eternal One, Prince of Peace,
His name is above (name is above),
His name is above ev'ry name!

Offspring of David, carpenter's Son,
Child of a virgin He came;
Lamb without blemish, Crucified One,
Immanuel, Jesus His name!

Risen Redeemer, Light of the world,
Almighty God we proclaim;
Alpha, Omega, ever the same,
His name is above every name!

16 TRUST AND OBEY

When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will, He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and o-bey.

Chorus:
Trust and obey! For there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and o-bey.

Not a shadow can rise, not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt nor a fear, not a sigh nor a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief nor a loss, not a frown nor a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove the delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favour He shows, and the joy He bestows,
Are for those who will trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do, where He sends we will go;
Never fear, only trust and obey.

17 MAKE ME A STRANGER

Make me a stranger on earth, dear Saviour,
Make me a stranger more like Thee.
Help me keep my focus on heavenly treasures,
And not on earthly, may it be.

Chorus:
Lord, lead me onward as a pilgrim
Bound for heaven never to roam.
Make me a stranger on earth, dear Saviour,
Till I see my heavenly home.

Lord, I've found myself loving earthly treasures:
Simple pleasures taking your place.
Nothing can measure to heavenly treasures:
Hearing, "Well done," and seeing your face.

18 THE HOLY HEART

The holy Heart was broken,
Sent from the Father's side;
The Son of God forsaken,
The holy sacrifice.

Chorus:
For me He was forsaken,
For me He died alone;
My sin forever taken
That I might be His own.

The holy Lamb was stricken,
Abandoned and alone;
He bore the world's affliction,
He bore it as His own.

And when my heart is broken,
Torn by my sin and pride;
The Son of God now risen
Will draw me to His side!

19 CREATE IN ME A CLEAN HEART

I came to the Lord with my heart full of sin,
Empty of purpose and troubled within.
My flesh had the vict'ry, My heart sought release;
Lord, wilt Thou cleanse me and grant me Thy peace?

Chorus:
Create in me a clean heart, my Father;
Renew a right spirit in me.
Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation;
May Christ be seen in me.

I cried to the Savior, "Forgive me, I pray."
He granted cleansing and sins fell away.
My bondage was ended, My heart was set free;
Lord, never more may I wander from Thee.

20 HAVE THINE OWN WAY, LORD

Have Thine own way, Lord, Have Thine own way;
Thou art the Potter; I am the clay:
Mould me and make me after Thy will,
While I am waiting, yielded and still.

Have Thine own way, Lord, Have Thine own way;
Search me and try me, Master, today.
Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,
As in Thy presence humbly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord, Have Thine own way;
Hold o'er my being absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit till all shall see
Christ only, always, living in me.

21 REJOICE IN THE LORD

God never moves without purpose or plan
When trying His servant and moulding a man.
Give thanks to the Lord though your testing seems long;
In darkness He giveth a song.

Chorus:
O rejoice in the Lord, He makes no mistake.
He knoweth the end of each path that I take.
For when I am tried and purified,
I shall come forth as gold.

I could not see through the shadows ahead;
So I looked at the cross of my Saviour instead.
I bowed to the will of the Master that day;
Then peace came and tears fled away.

Now I can see testing comes from above;
God strengthens His children and purges in love.
My Father knows best, and I trust in His care;
Through purging more fruit I will bear.

22 TURN YOUR EYES UPON JESUS

O soul, are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Saviour,
And life more abundant and free!

Chorus:
Turn your eyes upon Jesus;
Look full in His wonderful face;
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the Light of His glory and grace.

Through death into life everlasting
He passed, and we follow Him there;
Over us sin no more hath dominion,
For more than conquerors we are!

24 YOU ARE ALWAYS GOOD

Looking back, I can see Your fingerprints
Upon my life, always seeking my best.
There were times when Your way would make no sense;
But as You said, You have never left.

Chorus:
You are always good; You are only good.
You are always good to me.
Though my eyes can't see, help my heart believe
You are always, only good.

Looking in, I can see my frailty;
My sin is great, and my strength is so small.
Still You stay, and Your mercy shelters me;
You hold my hand, and You hear my call.

Looking up, I can see Your sympathy;
I doubt myself, but I'm sure of Your love.
Lavish grace was poured out at Calvary,
Securing me for our home above.

25 AT THE CROSS

Alas! And did my Saviour bleed?
And did my Sov'reign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?

Chorus:
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away (rolled away);
It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!

Was it for crimes that I have done,
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give myself away-
'Tis all that I can do!

26 TRUST ME

Do you trust Me as your Guide
Though My path for you is steep?
Will you lean on your own way,
Or resolve to follow Me?
I am still your Shepherd King
Who has led you with My love;
Since I see beyond your view,
Surely trust Me, faltering one.

Do you trust Me as your Rock
While the storm still rages on?
Every day new mercies grow,
Every night I give a song.
Since I reign as Prince of Peace,
Set your mind on things above.
Everlasting strength is Mine;
Fully trust Me, wearied one.

Will you trust Me with your life
When you face your final hour,
Soon to leave this broken world,
Destined for My jasper tower?
I am He who once was dead,
Now alive--My suffering done!
You will live for I arose;
Come be with Me, favored one.

27 MY CONFESSION

In the quiet of this moment,
I confess to You, O Lord,
That this frail, unworthy servant
Has rebelled against Your Word.
You are holy beyond measure
Without fault of any kind;
I am dust, corrupt by nature-
Flawed in body, word, and mind.

Chorus:
I am sinful; You are holy;
I'm unclean; You're undefiled.
Like a Father, please have pity
On Your feeble, falt'ring child.
Were it not for lovingkindness
I would soon be swept away,
But, in Christ, Your tender mercy
Grants forgiveness when I pray!

In this season of repentance,
I confess to You, my God,
That my nature tries to cover
Every action that is flawed.
You delight in true contrition,
Not in pious acts of praise,
And You heal my broken spirit
When I own my evil ways.

SOUNDTRACK: https://wilds.org/store/product/my-confession/

28 NOT I, BUT CHRIST

Not I but Christ be honoured, loved, exalted;
Not I but Christ be seen, be known, be heard;
Not I but Christ in ev'ry look and action;
Not I but Christ in ev'ry thought and word.

Chorus:
Oh, to be saved from myself, dear Lord!
Oh, to be lost in Thee!
Oh, that it may be no more I, dear Lord,
But Christ that lives in me.

Not I but Christ to gently soothe in sorrow;
Not I but Christ to wipe the falling tear;
Not I but Christ to lift the heavy burden;
Not I but Christ to hush away all fear.

Christ, only Christ, ere long will fill my vision;
Glory excelling soon, full soon I'll see -
Christ, only Christ my ev'ry wish fulfilling -
Christ, only Christ my all in all to be.

29 REDEEMED

Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
His child and forever I am.

Chorus:
Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed, redeemed,
His child, and forever, I am.

Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.

I know I shall see in His beauty
The King in whose law I delight;
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night.

30 HIS ROBES FOR MINE

His robes for mine: O wonderful exchange!
Clothed in my sin, Christ suffered 'neath God's rage.
Draped in His righteousness, I'm justified.
In Christ I live, for in my place He died.

Chorus:
I cling to Christ, and marvel at the cost:
Jesus forsaken, God estranged from God.
Bought by such love, my life is not my own:
My praise - my all - shall be for Christ alone.

His robes for mine: what cause have I for dread?
God's daunting Law Christ mastered in my stead.
Faultless I stand with righteous works not mine,
Saved by my Lord's vicarious death and life.

His robes for mine: God's justice is appeased.
Jesus is crushed, and thus the Father's pleased.
Christ drank God's wrath on sin, then cried "Tis done!"
Sin's wage is paid; propitiation won.

His robes for mine: such anguish none can know.
Christ, God's beloved, condemned as though His foe.
He, as though I, accursed and left alone;
I, as though He, embraced and welcomed home!

31 THE ONE WHO LIVES AGAIN

When Christ arose, He turned the tide
of human history
By dealing out a crushing blow
to His arch-enemy.
Before His risen glory,
fiendish foes flee in dismay,
Forever thrown into a state
of helpless disarray.
Praise the One who lives;
Praise the One who lives again;
Praise the One who lives again
for seizing victory!

When Christ arose, He offered
living hope to Adam's race
By swallowing the sting of death
and standing in our place.
Refusing to allow His
Holy One to see decay,
Our God will make His own complete
on Resurrection Day.
Praise the One who lives;
Praise the One who lives again;
Praise the One who lives again
to cancel our disgrace!

When Christ arose, He pried apart
the iron grip of sin
And gave us strength to walk anew
beneath His righteous reign.
The silent, empty tomb proclaims
these words for all to hear,
"Your sinful self is crucified
by resurrection pow'r!"
Praise the One who lives;
Praise the One who lives again;
Praise the One who lives again
for breaking ev'ry chain!

When Christ arose, He earned the right
of universal praise.
The high acclaim of His great name
will ring through endless days.
Alone He walked the path of death;
alone the Lamb was slain.
Together ev'ry tongue will sing
the honor of His name
Praise the One who lives;
Praise the One who lives again;
Praise the One who lives again
whose glory owns our gaze!

32 I STAND AMAZED

I stand amazed in the presence
of Jesus, my Lord and King,
And wonder how He could love me,
a sinner condemned, unclean.
For me He prayed in the garden,
"Father, not My will but Thine."
His tears were not for His own grief,
but sorrow for sins of mine.

Chorus:
I stand amazed, I stand in wonder,
I stand in awe of heaven's mystery!
I stand amazed at God's great mercy.
I stand amazed when I think of His love,
of Jesus' great love for me.

My sin and sorrow He carried
and made them His very own.
There in my place on Mount Calv'ry
Jesus suffered and died alone.
A love beyond comprehension,
that my Lord would die for me,
Inspires my heart to sing praises,
to worship eternally.

33 I STAND REDEEMED

At the dawn of eternity,
when the midst of time is gone,
When the choir of Heaven gathers
to begin redemption's song,
I will bow before my Savior
in a body new and whole.
Then I'll rise to sing His praises
while eternal ages roll.

Chorus:
I stand redeemed (redeemed)
by the blood of Jesus.
The price is paid (is paid):
my debt is gone (is gone).
The chains that bound me
no longer hold me.
Because of Calv'ry,
I stand redeemed.

As I gaze upon my Savior
at the wounds He bore for me,
I will sing of His salvation
bought with blood upon the tree.
While the host of angels listen
to a song they cannot sing
I will voice my praise to Jesus
with the song of the redeemed.

34 GOD'S SUFFICIENT WORD

Believe in God's inerrant Word,
Inspired and therefore pure.
Continue in the things you've learned,
for sacred Truth is sure.

Chorus:
Rejoice in God's delightful Word
That satisfies the soul-
Far sweeter than the honeycomb,
And more desired that gold!

Submit to God's transforming Word
Which makes the foolish wise.
The living, piercing, healing Sword
Yields righteousness through Christ.

mature through God's equipping word,
Until you're fully grown.
prepared to serve your gracious Lord,
Now work to make Him known.

Depend on God's sufficient Word,
Which cannot be improved.
In light of judgment and reward,
Proclaim His changeless Truth.

35 GRACE ALONE

Grace! 'tis a charming sound,
Harmonious to the ear;
Heav'n with the echo shall resound,
And all the earth shall hear,
And all the earth shall hear.

Chorus:
Saved by grace alone!
This is all my plea.
Jesus died for all mankind,
And Jesus died for me.

Grace wrote my wretched name
In life's eternal book;
'Twas grace that gave me to the Lamb,
Who all my sorrows took,
Who all my sorrows took.

Grace taught my heart to pray,
And made my eyes o'er-flow;
'Tis grace which kept me to this day,
And will not let me go,
And will not let me go.

Your law is my delight!

Now, fix my heart to walk within
The wisdom You supply!

And live for Jesus day after day.

Through ev'ry day new joy I find;
He gives to me real peace of mind.
Until the day when Christ I see
I'll live for Jesus who died for me.

38 GREAT IS THE LORD

In God's Word we read of a fallen race,
Lost and in sin, no hope of life within.
Then He came, the mighty conqu'ring King,
Gave His own life to pardon ev'ry sin.

Chorus:
Great is the Lord, the risen King.
Lift up your voice and gladly now proclaim:
Great is the Lord, the risen King.
Let us adore and praise His holy name.

In a tomb they laid the Lamb of God.
Sad was the day they viewed that awful place.
But He rose, triumphant o'er the grave,
Fulfilled God's plan to save a fallen race.

Ev'ry knee shall bow and honor Him,
Jesus the King, exalted and adored.
Crowns we'll cast before the sov'reign King.
With all the saints we'll worship Christ the Lord.

39 ONE DAY

One day when heaven was filled with His praises,
One day when sin was as black as could be,
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin,
Dwelt among men, my example is He!

Chorus:
Living, He loved me;
dying, He saved me;
Buried, He carried my sins far away;
Rising, He justified freely forever:
One day He's coming, oh glorious day!

One day they led Him up Calvary's mountain,
One day they nailed Him to die on a tree;
Suffering anguish, despised and rejected:
Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He!

One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,
One day the stone rolled away from the door;
Then He arose, over death He had conquered;
Now is ascended, my Lord evermore!

One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,
One day the skies with His glories will shine;
Wonderful day, my Beloved One bringing;
My Savior Jesus is mine!

40 MY HOPE IS JESUS

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
On Christ the solid rock I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand.

Chorus:
My hope is Jesus-
the anchor of my soul,
The ruler of this universe,
the One Who's in control.
He saved me, and He will keep me till the end.
The rock of my salvation-
on Christ I will depend.
My hope is Jesus! (My hope is Jesus)
My hope is Jesus!

When darkness hides my Savior's face,
I rest on His unchanging grace.
When faith is weak and doubt is strong,
I still lift up salvation's song.

When He shall come with trumpet sound,
O may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.

You are worthy, worthy and wonderful;
worthy of worship and praise.

Worthy of rev'rence, worthy of awe,
Worthy of love and devotion.

worthy of all this and added to these.

Almighty Father, Master and Lord,
King of all kings and Redeemer.
Wonderful Counselor, Comforter, Friend,
Saviour and Source of our life without end.

Precious Word, what treasure does Your counsel afford,
Giving grace to the weak, granting strength from the Lord.

Ev'ry freedom is found in the gift of Your Word!

Your Word will stand, Your Truth will prevail,
No comfort lack, no promise will fail.
Oh, let Your Law rich grace impart,
To hide Your Word within my heart.

Precious Word, what wisdom do Your precepts unfold,
Giving light to my path, yielding mercies untold.
Giving sight to the blind, so the blinded can see,
Giving life to the dead, as the Gospel did me!

Precious Word, what comfort You provide for the soul,
Giving hope to the world, healing hearts, making whole.
Giving strength to the faint, calling faint to be strong,
Telling weary to sing, giving weary their song!

My Lord abides with me.

How can I fear? Jesus is near.
He ever watches over me.
Worries all cease; He gives me peace.

My life I give to You, O Lord, Use me, I pray
May I glorify Your precious name in all I do and say,

Knowing You will always lead me; Your will is always right

Chorus:
I know God makes no mistakes.
He leads in ev'ry path I take
Along the way that's leading me to home.
Though' at times my heart would break,
There's a purpose in ev'ry change He makes;
That others would see my life
and know that God makes no mistakes.

And when some day in heav'n above I see His dear face,
May I then be counted faithful as a runner in this race.
But now I'm trusting in the Saviour to show me the way,
In His righteousness He guides me, as I seek to please Him day by day.

46 EMBRACE THE CROSS

Behold the cross where Life Eternal died,
God's Lamb, the Christ, our final sacrifice.
No other blood removes iniquity.
No other man redeems humanity!

Chorus:
Embrace the cross, and glory in its shame;
With all your heart, live worthy of His name!
O follow Christ regardless of the cost,
Give ev'rything to Jesus; embrace the cross.

Take up your cross upon the Calvary road;
With steadfast faith, remain beneath the load.
Consider all the suffering Jesus knew.
Consider Him; His grace will carry you.

Proclaim the cross till ev'ry nation hears
That for our sin the Son of God was pierced.
In Jesus' name, go forth in Gospel might!
In Jesus' love, present Christ crucified!

Lay down your cross before the nail scarred feet
Of Him who reigns in royal majesty.
Exchange your cross for Heaven's great reward!
Exchange your crown for Jesus Christ the Lord!

47 HERE IS GOD

Here is God, at last revealed,
In the person of a Son.
All the words of all the prophets
In one final Word have come.
He is sleeping in a stable,
Living breathing Son of Man.
God the King has left His heaven
To become a little Lamb.

Here is God, our second Adam,
True fulfiller of the law.
Death till now has reigned unchallenged;
Christ will triumph o'er the fall.
Tried and tempted, but unsinning,
He will take our sinner's place.
He's the firstborn out of many,
Founder of the Christian race.

Here is God, the risen Conq'rer;
Sing His praise eternally.
Our hearts' longing now is granted:
His pure unveiled face we see.
Heaven's greatest Treasure given,
Unrestricted, unrestrained,
To the Church He died to ransom
For the glory of His Name.

48 MORE LOVE

O Lord, Your love is so vast and so wide,
freely given to all who believe.
It soars above the highest sky
and it floods the deepest sea.
It moved Your heart to send Your only Son
to die on Calvary's tree.
And now Your love has been poured in my soul,
that its water may flow through me.

O Lord, I come to You with great shame,
for I fear my work is in vain.
I am moved by the sound of man's empty praise,
when I serve others in Your name.
If I give my wealth as a gift to the poor,
or my body to the flames of the fire,
Still all will be lost when I stand in Your sight
if my motives are not love inspired.

O Lord, how I long to be filled with Your love;
I lift up my dry, thirsty soul.
Overcome this love that I have for myself,
as I yield to the Spirit's control.
May the love of Christ increase in my heart,
and my knowledge of Him ever grow,
So the service I give to my King above
will reflect the love that He's shown.

49 REFUGE (PSALM 91)

Chorus:
If I dwell in the shelter of Jesus,
And I hide in the shadow of God,
I will say to the Lord,
"You're my Refuge and Strength.
You're the One in whom I can trust.
You're my God, in You I will trust."

I will not feat the terror of midnight,
Or the arrow that flies in the day,
Or the evil that stalks where the darkness is strong,
Or the flesh that is wasting away.

Though a thousand may fail in my presence,
Or ten thousand should fall by my side,
You protect me from harm and the fears that alarm,
In the shade of Your strength I abide.

In all I do, in all I say,
May Jesus Christ be praised,

The night becomes as day
When from the heart we say:

The pow'rs of darkness fear
When this sweet song they hear:
May Jesus Christ be praised (be praised)!

In heav'n's eternal bliss
The loveliest strain is this:
May Jesus Christ be praised!
Let earth, and sea, and sky
From depth to height reply:

My canticle divine:
May Jesus Christ be praised!
Be this th'eternal song
Through all the ages long:
May Jesus Christ be praised (be praised)!

51 PERFECT PEACE

When life's burdens get so heavy and it seems I'm all alone,
I cast my care on Jesus and come boldly to His throne.
I find His grace sufficient when His promises I heed.
For His very life He sacrificed, and He lives to intercede.

Chorus:
He is the Lord of lords, and when He speaks,
Winds and waves obey.
When Jesus whispers, "Peace, be still,"
Then darkness turns to day.
And as I'm trusting in my Saviour's word
Doubts and fears all cease.
And beneath the shelter of His wings
I'm at rest in perfect peace.

I will seek for souls in darkness, Calv'ry's love with them to share.
Empowered by His Spirit I will follow anywhere.
For I know whate'er befall me my Lord is in control.
And as my mind is stayed on him perfect peace He gives my soul.

Though the path I travel be unknown,

We can be sure we are secure within His hands.
He is our joy, our hope of life eternal,

His word is a lamp unto our feet.
And when the laughter turns to sorrow,
In His embrace, we find His grace, when we are weak.

And there our Saviour greet.

And worship at His feet.

All these stains within me prove my iniquity.

Freed from sin's dark prison, yet still I run back in.
Lead me by Your Spirit to walk in paths of light.

By Your loving covenant we'll never be alone.
Hold us close as children who look to You for care.

Ceaseless like a fountain, Your mercy will endure.
Pour out love and kindness upon me lavishly.

When I'm burdened by my sin,

He has paid redemption's price
On the cross of Calvary.

Let His praises adorn this place.
Bless the Lord for His tender mercies;
Let me never forget His grace.

Healing ev'ry hidden hurt,
Turning pain to sweet relief.

Endless mercies pouring down-
Then I know His steadfast love
Rests upon me like a crown.

Through You I will prevail, Lord,

Unleash the power of the Word.
The Holy Spirit's sov'reign Blade
Can never fail to wound and save.

The Sword is ancient, yet still new.
It ever speaks to Adam's race
Eternal words from age to age.

Still sharper than a double edge,
The Sword will pierce the hearts of men,
Exposing all our secret thoughts
Before the searching eyes of God.

With shattered conscience for our ways,
We look to Christ for healing grace.
For though the Word lays bare our sin,
We find new life and hope in Him.

In that holy place.

Of His sovereign grace I'll sing!
Tell of love's great sacrifice;
Live a life that points to Christ!

Not in works that I have done.

Who reigns as Heaven's King.
When He calls me home to glory,
His eternal praise I'll sing!

The clouds be rolled back as a scroll,
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend!

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father through Jesus the Son,

To every believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly believes
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, and greater will be
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.

71 HE'S AN UNCHANGING SAVIOR

When the scenes of life shift about us
like the backdrops in a play,
Were our trust in the things that surround us,
in the things that pass away,
We should then be full of confusion, without hope and in dismay.
What a joy instead to be anchored to the rock that will ever stay!

Chorus:
Then we will press onward, for Christ is still the same.
What He was in ages past is what He will remain.
And forevermore that is what He will be,
For time and for eternity!
He's an unchanging Savior, with an undying love.
He's an unchanging Savior, our life, our surety.

He alone laid the earth's foundations
and then pronounced them good.
He alone can impart salvation
for He bought it with His blood.
Though the heathen vainly imagine they can cast his pow'r aside,
We will stake our claim on the all sufficient name that will ever abide!

76 COME, THOU FOUNT

Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
Sung by flaming tongues above;
Praise the mount - I'm fixed upon it,
Mount of Thy redeeming love.

Here I raise mine Ebenezer -
Hither by Thy help I'm come;
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
Safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wand'ring from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
Bought me with his precious blood.

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be!
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,
Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee:
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
Prone to leave the God I love;
Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
Seal it for Thy courts above.

77 THE PRECIOUS BLOOD

The precious blood of Jesus Christ,
the covenant of grace,
Unveils the wonders of God's love
to Adam's fallen race.
The sov'reign King who died for all,
redeems us from our sin,
And makes us kings and priests of God
where we shall reign with Him.

The precious blood of Jesus Christ,
a new and living way,
Gives access to a holy place
where we can boldly pray.
In trying times of grief and pain,
a throne of grace is ours,
Where mercy flows for every need
with God's sustaining power.

The precious blood of Jesus Christ,
the song of saints above,
Who glory in the risen Lamb
and boast of God's great love.
From every nation, tribe, and tongue,
one body all are we:
A people joined by grace alone
for all eternity.

78 BENEATH THE CROSS OF JESUS

Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand;
The shadow of a mighty rock
within a weary land;
A home within the wilderness,
a rest upon the way,
From the burning of the noontide heat,
and the burden of the day.

Upon the cross of Jesus
mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
who suffered there for me;
And from my smitten heart with tears
two wonders I confess;
The wonders of redeeming love,
and my unworthiness.

I take, O cross, thy shadow
for my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
the sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by,
to know no gain or loss,
My sinful self my only shame,
my glory all the cross.

79 LORD, SEND ME ANYWHERE

O Lord, since Thou hast died
To give Thyself for me,
No sacrifice could be too great
For me to make for Thee.

Chorus:
Lord, send me anywhere,
Only go with me;
Lay any burden on me,
Only sustain me.
Sever any tie,
Save the tie that binds me to Thy heart-
Lord Jesus, my King,
I consecrate my life, Lord to Thee.

I only have one life,
And that will soon be past;
I want my life to count for Christ,
What's done for Him will last.

I follow Thee, My Lord,
And glory in Thy cross;
I gladly leave the world behind
And count all gain as loss.

80 WONDERFUL, MERCIFUL SAVIOR

Wonderful, merciful Savior,
Precious Redeemer and Friend;
Who would have thought that a Lamb
could Rescue the souls of men?
Oh, You rescue the souls of men.

Chorus:
You are the One that we praise;
You are the One we adore.
You give the healing and grace
Our hearts always hunger for,
Oh, our hearts always hunger for.

Counselor, Comforter, Keeper,
Spirit we long to embrace,
You offer hope when our hearts have
Hopelessly lost our way.
Oh, we've hopelessly lost the way.

Almighty, Infinite Father,
Faithfully loving Your own,
Here in our weakness You find us
Falling before Your throne
Oh, we're falling before Your throne.

81 AM I A SOLDIER OF THE CROSS

Am I a soldier of the cross,
A foll'wer of the Lamb?
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?

Must I be carried to the skies
On flow'ry beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas?

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stern the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace
To help me on to God?

Sure I must fight if I would reign;
Increase my courage, Lord!
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by Thy Word.

82 MAY THE LORD FIND US FAITHFUL

God has not given us the spirit of fear,
But has given us the strength to obey.
With power and sound mind, with love, the unfailing kind,
O be not ashamed of His way.

Chorus:
May the Lord find us faithful.
May His Word be our banner held high.
May the Lord find us faithful
Ev'ry day, though we live, though we die.

No man that seeketh after things of this life
Is a soldier who passes the test.
Be faithful, be working, be running, be serving,
Be searching His Word for His best.

Living or dying, may honour be Thine,
From this wretched life, You loved and forgave.
A life that is on fire, be only our heart's desire.
Be faithful from now to the grave.

83 GRACE

Lord, as I seek Your guidance for the day,
I find my thoughts unyielding;
confusion crowds my way.
But then when I bow to You,
the challenges You guide me through;
Your promises are ever new,
I claim them for today.

Chorus:
Your will cannot lead me
where Your grace will not keep me.
Your hand will protect me. I rest in Your care.
Your eyes will watch over me,
Your love will forgive me.
And when I am faltering, I still will find You there.

84 I WILL PRAISE HIM

When I saw the cleansing fountain,
Open wide for all my sin,
I obeyed the Spirit's wooing
When He said, "Wilt thou be clean?"

Chorus:
I will praise Him! I will praise Him!
Praise the Lamb for sinners slain;
Give Him glory, all ye people,
For His blood can wash away each stain.

Though the way seems straight and narrow,
All I claimed was swept away;
My ambitions, plans, and wishes,
At my feet in ashes lay.

Blessed be the name of Jesus!
I'm so glad He took me in;
He's forgiven my transgressions,
He has cleansed my heart from sin.

Glory, glory to the Father!
Glory, glory to the Son!
Glory, glory to the Spirit!
Glory to the Three in One!

85 O HOW HE LOVES YOU AND ME

O how He loves you and me,
O how He loves you and me;
He gave His life-
what more could He give?
O how He loves you, O how He loves me,
O how He loves you and me!

Jesus to Calv'ry did go,
His love for mankind to show;
What He did there brought hope from despair:
O how He loves you, O how He loves me,
O how He loves you and me!

86 HIS NAME IS WONDERFUL

His name is Wonderful, His name is Wonderful,
His name is Wonderful, Jesus my Lord.
He is the mighty King, master of ev'rything,
His name is Wonderful, Jesus my Lord.
He's the great Shepherd, the Rock of all ages,
Almighty God is He.
Bow down before Him, love and adore Him,
His name is Wonderful, Jesus my Lord.

87 AMAZING GRACE

Amazing grace! how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

Through many dangers, toils, and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me,
His Word my hope secures;
He will my Shield and Portion be,
As long as life endures.

When we've been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we'd first begun.

88 ALL HAIL THE POWER

All hail the pow'r of Jesus' Name!
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all!

Ye chosen seed of Israel's race,
Ye ransomed from the fall,
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all;
Hail Him Who saves you by His grace,
And crown Him Lord of all!

Let every kindred, every tribe,
On this terrestrial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all;
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown Him Lord of all!

O that with yonder sacred throng
We at His feet may fall!
We'll join the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all;
We'll join the everlasting song,
And crown Him Lord of all!

89 GOD'S WORD, MY GUIDE

When disappointments of my life surround
And cause my heart to fear what lies before,
Within God's Word my trembling spirit hides,
I learn to trust His wisdom more and more.

Chorus:
God's Word, my guide, my leadership within,
Ordain my steps to follow in Your way,
Return me once again to walk by faith,
And rest within Your truth from day to day.

I may not understand God's ways for me,
But this I know: His Word will never fail,
And when life's trials seem too hard to bear,
I know that through it all God will prevail.

God's Word illumines ev'ry step I take,
Securely it surrounds me in His love,
With comfort, brightens feeble paths of fear,
Reminding me of better things above.

90 THE OLD RUGGED CROSS

On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suff'ring and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

Chorus:
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it someday for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true,
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

91 TEACH ME YOUR WAY, LORD

Teach me Your way, Lord, Teach me Your way.
Show me the path to follow today.
Guide me through valleys when it's hard to see.
Help me to trust You for all that I need.
Teach me Your way, Lord, teach me Your way.

Teach me Your way, Lord, Teach me Your way.
Talk to my heart when I kneel to pray.
Help me to be who You want me to be.
I want to follow wherever You lead.
Teach me Your way, Lord, teach me Your way.

92 BE AN EXAMPLE

Many now are watching the footsteps that we take;
Many soon will follow in the choices that we make.
So let us then be faithful to be what we should be,
And leave a good example that they can clearly see.

Chorus:
Be an example of the believers, in word and in conduct;
Be steadfast in love, in faith in purity of life.
For those behind us, let us stand within the gap and
make a diff'rence in their lives;
Be an example to follow Christ.

Let us then be watching the weary, day by day,
Looking to encourage and to lead in the way;
To run the race with patience; On Jesus fix our eyes,
And challenge them with excellence, that they might win the prize.

93 BOW THE KNEE

What a privilege to come into God's presence,
Just to linger with the One who set me free.
As I lift my eyes and see His awesome glory,
I remember who He is and bow the knee.

Chorus:
Bow the knee, (bow the knee)
bow the knee, (bow the knee)
He is King of all the ages, bow the knee.
God alone, (God alone)
on His throne, (on His throne)
see Him high and lifted up and bow the knee!
Kneel before Him, all adore Him.
As you live to love Him more, bow the knee.

In His hand He holds the power of creation,
With His voice He spoke and all things came to be.
Yet He hears each simple prayer I bring before Him
When I humbly seek His face and bow the knee.

94 HOLY PLACE

There is a holy place far from my rapid pace
Where I seek face to face my God and King.
I must go ev'ry day, and that without delay,
To read His word and pray and praises bring.

Chorus:
The Word of God will light the darkest path,
Its treasures flow with strength anew.
Help me to hide its words within my heart;
Take this hour, make me more like You!

So from my holy place back to my rapid pace
I bravely run the race he set for me.
He'll lead me all the way if I His Word obey
And on the altar lay anxiety.

95 JESUS PAID IT ALL

I hear the Savior say,
"Thy strength indeed is small!
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all."

Chorus:
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain-
He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow'r, and Thine alone,
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone.

And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete,
"Jesus died my soul to save,"
My lips shall still repeat.

96 RESURRECTION ANTHEM

If Jesus has not risen,
Our faith and preaching is in vain.
If Jesus has not risen,
Then we remain condemned in sin.

Chorus:
But Christ indeed is risen,
He is the first of more to come.
Christ indeed is risen,
And will convey His children home.
Yes, Christ indeed is risen,
All will be subject to the King!
Christ indeed is risen,
O conquered death, where is your sting?

If Jesus has not risen,
Our dead are lost forevermore.
If Jesus has not risen,
Then it is senseless to endure.

If Jesus has not risen,
Our hope will fail when life is through.
If Jesus has not risen,
Then shameful pity is our due.

If Jesus has not risen,
Our adversary has prevailed.
If Jesus has not risen,
Then all God's promises have failed.

In You alone a blessed peace I find.

98 KEEP YOUR HEART

Now on this mountain-top
we have gleaned so many things.
We've been drawn closer to His heart,
a place that trial brings.
We have seen vict'ry over sin,
and witnessed answered prayer.
We have known Christ be our only strength,
found His word a jewel rare.

Chorus:
Keep your heart, keep your heart,
keep your heart with all diligence.
Keep it clean, keep it pure,
make your love for Christ endure.
Guard your ears, guard your eyes,
pressing onward to the prize.
Lest you fall, lest you fail,
make your love for Christ prevail.

Now from this mountain top
to your valley here below,
You have all of the armory
to defeat that wicked foe.

100 LAMB OF GLORY

Hear the story from God's Word
That kings and priests and prophets heard;
There would be a sacrifice,
And blood would flow to pay sin's price.

Chorus:
Precious Lamb of glory,
Love's most wondrous story,
Heart of God's redemption of man;
Worship the Lamb of glory.

On the cross God loved the world
While all the pow'rs of hell were hurled;
No one there could understand
The One they saw was Christ the Lamb.

101 GRACE GREATER THAN OUR SIN

Marvellous grace of our loving Lord,
Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt,
Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured,
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.

Chorus:
Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within;
Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that is greater than all our sin.

Dark is the stain that we cannot hide,
What can avail to wash it away?
Look! There is flowing a crimson tide;
Whiter than snow you may be today.

Marvellous, infinite, matchless grace,
Freely bestowed on all who believe;
You that are longing to see His face,
Will you this moment His grace receive?

102 O FOR A THOUSAND TONGUES

O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace!

My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad
The honours of Thy name.

Jesus! the name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease;
'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
'Tis life and health and peace.

He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
He sets the pris'ner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean,
His blood availed for me.

103 WHEN WE ALL GET TO HEAVEN

Sing the wondrous love of Jesus,
Sing His mercy and His grace;
In the mansions bright and blessed,
He'll prepare for us a place.

Chorus:
When we all get to heaven,
What a day of rejoicing that will be!
When we all see Jesus,
We'll sing and shout the victory.

Let us then, be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving every day;
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of earth repay.

Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we'll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold.

104 NO OTHER NAME

One offer of salvation,
To all the world make known;
The only sure foundation
Is Christ, the Cornerstone.

Chorus:
No other name is given,
No other way is known,
Jesus Christ, the First and Last
He saves, and He alone.

One only door of Heaven
Stands open wide today,
One sacrifice is given,
It is Christ, the living way.

My only song and story
Is Jesus died for me;
My only hope of glory
Is the cross of Calvary.

105 FOR ME TO LIVE IS CHRIST

In life or death I'll not despair;
My hope in Him, I'll boldly share.
To live is Christ; to die is gain.
I seek to magnify His name.

For me to live is Christ;
For me to live is Christ.
Pursuing Him, my highest prize,
For me to live is Christ.

He came to earth in servant form,
To bear the cross, the shame, the scorn.
This mind of Christ I'll make my own,
To serve with humble heart alone.

To know my Lord surpasses all;
To press t'ward Him, my single goal,
To know His vict'ry o'er the grave,
To know His mighty pow'r to save!

So joy in Christ and never cease
And run to Him; He brings true peace.
Content in Him in every state,
In all be strengthened by His grace!

But Thou, O Christ, hast died for me,
And Thou wilt hear my prayers.

Chorus:
To Thee alone, the Crucified,
the sinner's only plea,
Relying on Thy promised grace,
my faith still clings to Thee.

The world is dark without Thee, Lord,
I turn me from its strife,
To find Thy love, a sweet relief;
Thou art the light of life.

Temptations lure and fears assail
my frail, inconstant heart,
But precious are Thy promises,
and they new strength impart.

Unfold Thy precepts to my mind,
and cleanse my blinded eyes;
Grant me to work for Thee on earth,
then praise Thee in the skies.

Help me follow You alone;
Take my hand and lead me home.

Great God and Father of our Lord,

Now, as His children, we've received
a legacy of grace.

Securing Spirit giv'n by God

Before the glorious throne of God
where faith and sight will meet.

Draw me, my Savior, so precious Thou art;
Fold me, O fold me close to Thy breast,
Shelter me safe in that "Haven of Rest,"
Shelter me safe in that "Haven of Rest."

Nearer, still nearer- nothing I bring,
Naught as an off'ring to Jesus, my King;
Only my sinful, now contrite heart;
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart,
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.

Nearer, still nearer- Lord, to be Thine,
Sin, with its follies I gladly resign;
All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride;
Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified,
Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.

While things of earth will perish, You remain the same.
From the depths below to the heights above,
Nothing can separate me from Your love (from Your love).

As Magi fell before His majesty.
The time had come for David's promised Heir
To free us from the grip of Satan's snare.

Chorus:
So we will bow before our worthy King,
And we will vow to give Him ev'rything.
We take our cross and follow all our days;
We worship Him with lives of grateful praise.
We will live for Christ the King.

Behold the King in bloody pageantry,
A worthless crown to scorn His royalty.
In Pilate's hall He claimed no earthly throne;
He reigned supreme as Lord in hearts alone.

Behold the King in true humility,
Abused by men upon that cursed tree.
He would endure the darkness of our shame
To die our death and magnify His name.

Behold the King for all eternity
Enthroned on high in total sov'reignty.
He entertains no rival to His crown;
The world is His! All praise to Him resound!

Faithful and true each day;
Heed what He saith, do what He willeth,

Glory to His name;
There to my heart was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!

I am so wondrously saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly abides within;
There at the cross where he took me in;
Glory to His name!

O precious fountain that saves from sin,
I am so glad I have entered in;
There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean
Glory to His name!

Come to this fountain so rich and sweet,
Cast thy poor soul at the Saviour's feet;
Plunge in today, and be made complete;

Teach me the mission appointed for me,
What is my labour, and where it shall be.

Chorus:
Master, Thou callest, and this I reply,
"Ready and willing, Lord, here am I."

Willing, my Saviour, to take up the cross;
Willing to suffer reproaches and loss.
Willing to follow, if Thou will but lead;
Only support me with grace in my need.

Living or dying, I still would be Thine;
Yet I am mortal while Thou art divine.
Pardon whenever I turn from the right;
Pity and bring me again to the light.

That made the mountains rise,
That spread the flowing seas abroad,
And built the lofty skies.
I sing the wisdom that ordained
The sun to rule the day;
The moon shines full at His command,
And all the stars obey.

I sing the goodness of the Lord
That filled the earth with food;
He formed the creatures with His word
And then pronounced them good.
Lord, how Thy wonders are displayed
Where'er I turn my eye:
If I survey the ground I tread,
Or gaze upon the sky!

There's not a plant or flow'r below
But makes Thy glories known;
And clouds arise and tempests blow
By order from Thy throne;
While all that borrows life from Thee
Is ever in Thy care,
And ev'rywhere that man can be,
Thou, God, art present there.

118 THE OBJECT OF YOUR LOVE

Apart from God, a slave to sin,
My guilt too much to bear.
My heart has found no hope within,
And peace gives way to care.
Yet now I see Your broken form
Upon dark Calvary.
It was my fault that You were torn;
You proved Your love for me.

Chorus:
Now I am Yours, and You are mine,
O precious thought to me!
The priceless gift of love divine
Provides security.
The life I owe such mercy
Could never be enough.
But thank you, Lord, for making me
The object of Your love.

With contrite heart I bow in shame
Before my God above.
Without regard for His great name,
I've sinned against His love.
Yet now my Savior's words I hear
Within this holy place,
"My friend, there is no need to fear,
You're at the Throne of Grace."

And when I feel my heart would break
For grief within my soul,
Help me to know there's no mistake;
My God is in control.
Yet now I feel eternal arms
Supporting me inside.
You are a shade from every harm,
You'll never leave my side.

119 OUR GOD IS MIGHTY

Our God is mighty, worthy of all praising,
Sing unto him a glad, triumphant song;
He is the Lord, supreme in earth and heaven;
To Him all strength and majesty belong.

Chorus:
Declare His glory among the nations;
Through all creation his triumph sing,
Till all earth's peoples bow in adoration
And Jesus Christ be everlasting King.

Our God is gracious, infinite in mercy;
He bridged the hopeless gulf our sin had made;
He gave his Son to purchase our salvation-
In Jesus Christ we meet God unafraid!

Our God is faithful; He will work within us,
Fulfilling all the purpose He has planned,
Cleansing our hearts and filling with His Spirit,
Making us strong to keep his last command.

Our God is sov'reign over all creation,
And soon His earth shall hear His mighty voice;
With shout of joy the King shall come in splendor-
Lift up your hearts, confess him, and rejoice!

120 TO WHOM MUCH HAS BEEN GIVEN

We gather in God's presence
To worship Him this hour.
We honour and exalt Him,
We kneel to Him in prayer.
Our words are but a silence
Unless we do as He desires.
For to whom much has been given
Much more shall be required.

Chorus:
To whom much has been given
Much more shall be required.
You have given gold and silver;
Will you give to Him your lives?
Will you labour with your Savior?
Will you do as He desires?
For to whom much has been given
Much more shall be required.

To seek the lost and hungry
And feed them with His Word,
To reach out to our enemies,
And embrace them with His love,
Empowered and commissioned,
So we must do as He desires.
For to whom much has been given
Much more shall be required.

121 FAITHFUL MEN

I am looking to Jesus,
giving all in the race,
Pressing upward to gain the heavenly prize.
Faithful men are my witness,
who have struggled and died;
And they watch from the grandstand in the skies.

Chorus:
Faithful men have gone before us,
Faithful men who fight and stand;
I want to follow in their footsteps,
Guided by those faithful men.

Jacob joined with the faithful;
Joseph followed behind;
Moses ran with the mighty men of old.
There were David and Daniel;
then came Peter and Paul.
Now they chant as they run on streets of gold.

122 AS THE DEER

As the deer panteth for the water,
So my soul longeth after You.
You alone are my heart's desire,
And I long to worship You.

Chorus:
You alone are my strength, my shield;
To You alone may my spirit yield.
You alone are my heart's desire,
and I long to worship You.

You're my friend and You are my brother,
Even though You are a King,
I love You more than any other,
So much more than anything.

123 NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE

Nothing is impossible
when you put your trust in God;
Nothing is impossible
when you're trusting in His Word.
Hearken to the voice of God to thee:
"Is there anything too hard for Me?"
Then put your trust in God alone
and rest upon His Word;
For everything, O everything,
yes, everything is possible with God!

124 MY JESUS, I LOVE THEE

My Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;
For Thee all the follies of sin I resign.
My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou;
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me,
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree.
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;
If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now.

I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death,
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;
And say, when the deathdew lies cold on my brow,
"If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now."

In mansions of glory and endless delight,
I'll ever adore Thee in heaven so bright.
I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow,
"If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, 'tis now."

125 LIKE A RIVER GLORIOUS

Like a river glorious
Is God's perfect peace,
Over all victorious
In its bright increase;
Perfect, yet it floweth
Fuller every day,
Perfect, yet it groweth
Deeper all the way.

Chorus:
Stayed upon Jehovah,
Hearts are fully blest-
Finding as He promised,
Perfect peace and rest.

Hidden in the hollow
Of His blessed hand,
Never foe can follow,
Never traitor stand;
Not a surge of worry,
Not a shade of care,
Not a blast of hurry
Touch the spirit there.

Every joy or trial
Falleth from above,
Traced upon our dial
By the Sun of Love:
We may trust Him fully
All for us to do;
They who trust Him wholly
Find Him wholly true.

126 STAND UP FOR JESUS

Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
Ye soldiers of the cross,
Lift high His royal banner,
It must not suffer loss;
From vict'ry unto vict'ry,
His army shall He lead,
Till ev'ry foe is vanquished
And Christ is Lord indeed.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
Stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you-
Ye dare not trust your own;
Put on the gospel armor,
Each piece put on with prayer,
Where duty calls or danger,
Be never wanting there.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
The strife will not be long;
This day the noise of battle,
The next, the victor's song;
To him who overcometh,
A crown of life shall be;
He with the King of Glory
Shall reign eternally.

127 MY HOPE IS IN THE LORD

My hope is in the Lord
Who gave Himself for me,
And paid the price of
all my sin at Calvary.

Chorus:
For me (for me) He died (He died),
for me (for me) He lives (He lives),
And everlasting life and light
He freely gives.

And now for me He stands
Before the Father's throne,
He shows His wounded hands
and names me as His own.

His grace has planned it all,
'Tis mine but to believe,
And recognize His work of love,
and Christ receive.

128 JESUS, MASTER OF MY HEART

Jesus, Master of my heart,
Worthy One of all my praise,
To my longing eyes impart
All the wonder of Your ways!
Altogether Lovely One,
Earthly treasures fade from view;
You along my heart have won,
Let me lose myself in You.

Jesus, Savior of my soul,
Fully paid redemption's price,
Purchased not with tarnished gold
But with bloody sacrifice!
Holy, spotless Lamb of God,
For my sin You suffered so;
My unworthy soul You sought,
Loyalty, the debt I owe.

Jesus, Healer of my pain,
Touch my heart with heaven's balm,
Strengthen me beneath the strain,
I'm engraved upon Your palm!
Everlasting Son of Man,
Precious is the hope You bring;
Ev'ry wound You understand,
Come with healing in Your wings.

Jesus, Pilot of my life,
Safely guide to heaven's shore
Till my weary soul arrives
In Your arms forevermore!
Captain of eternity,
Navigate me by Your grace;
Welcome me so tenderly,
As my eyes behold Your face.

129 MAY THE MIND OF CHRIST

May the mind of Christ my Savior
live in me from day to day,
by His love and pow'r controlling
all I do and say.
May the Word of God dwell richly
in my heart from hour to hour,
So that all may see I triumph
only through God's love and pow'r.

May the peace of God my Father
rule my life in ev'rything,
That I may be calm to comfort
the sick and sorrowing.
May the love of Jesus fill me
as the waters fill the sea,
Christ exalting, self-abasing,
for this is victory.

130 HOLY, HOLY

In the throne room of heaven, 
high and exalted, sits the King on His throne.
Seraphim flying; loudly they're crying
unto the Lord God alone.

Chorus:
He is holy, holy;
the earth is full of His glory.
Holy, holy
is the Lord God of hosts.

To a hill called Mount Calv'ry,
love took our Savior so all men could be free;
Satan defeating, wounded and bleeding,
our spotless Lamb on the tree.

Here am I, send and use me,
fit me for service, purge my spirit anew.
Search me and try me, cleanse, purify me
so I can be more like You!

131 BEHOLD HOW EVERY WOUND

Behold how ev'ry wound of Christ
Distills a precious cure.
Those searing marks have paid the price
To make this sinner pure.

Chorus:
The bleeding Lamb bears holy wounds 
Of mercy full and free.
His body shines a crimson hue
That ever pleads for me.

His hammered hands, His thorny crown,
His wounded, piercèd side
Preach gospel grace that trickles down-
None but Christ could provide.

Grim injuries left me dismayed-
For me He was accused?
His wounds healed scars my sin had made
When love and suff'ring fused.

The wonders of redeeming love
Bring triumph, not defeat.
Both here on earth and soon above
I'll worship at His feet.

132 I WILL FOLLOW

I will follow Thee, my Saviour,
Where'er the pathway may go:
Through the storm or through the valley
Or through great trials so low.

Chorus:
I rest in Thee, trust in Thee,
I place my life in Thy hands.
I will follow Thee, my Saviour;
Lead on, my Shepherd, lead on.

I will live for Thee, my Saviour,
Though war and strife mark the way.
I'm so weak, but Thou art mighty,
So live through me day by day.

I surrender all, my Saviour,
I hold no thing back from Thee;
Every part is Thine to use, Lord,
Thy living sacrifice be.

133 BE THOU MY VISION

Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art;
Thou my best thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true Word;
I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord;
Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son,
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise;
Thou my inheritance, now and always;
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.

High King of heaven, my victory won,
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heav'n's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.

134 GREAT IS THY FAITHFULNESS

Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father;
There is no shadow of turning with Thee.
Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not;
As Thou hast been Thou forever wilt be.

Chorus:
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Great is Thy faithfulness!
Morning by morning new mercies I see;
All I have needed Thy hands hath provided;
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!

Summer and winter, and springtime and harvest,
Sun, moon and stars in their courses above
Join with all nature in manifold witness
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.

Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!

135 BY THE GENTLE WATERS

By the gentle waters, You will safely lead me,
In green pastures feed me, knowing what is best.
Though I often stray, wander far away,
I can hear you say, "Come to me and rest."

There's no need to fear when the Shepherd's near.
When your voice I hear, I find comfort sure.
Free from all alarm, sheltered from all harm,
Safely in your arms, I can rest secure.

Jesus loving Shepherd, You'll forsake me never.
In Your flock forever, I am not alone.
Though the darkness hide me, You are close beside me.
Gentle shepherd, guide me 'til I'm safely home.

136 COME QUICKLY, LORD

Creation groans beneath the curse-
Rebellion's just reward.
We long to see the fall reversed
And Eden's joys restored.

Chorus:
Come quickly, Lord! Make all things new!
Redeem the church, Your bride.
With longing eyes we look for You,
For home is at Your side!

So weary of our trait'rous flesh-
Of sin we hate, yet crave-
We yearn to see temptation's death,
Indwelling sin's dark grave.

We want to hear the joyous cries
And join the ransomed throng:
"The Lamb is worthy!" praise will rise
From ev'ry tribe and tongue!

We joy to fix our gaze on Christ,
Though now our view is dim.
We long for heaven's grandest prize:
To see and be like Him!

137 WE COME INTO YOUR PRESENCE

O God, we come into Your presence
Through the merits of Your Son,
In whom we have so great salvation
By the shedding of His blood.
His life, His death, His resurrection
Give an entrance to your throne.
As we bow before You, Father,
You receive us as Your own.

O God, the presence of Your Spirit
Still the raging of the soul.
He longs to give us daily wisdom
As we yield to His control.
He understands each groan or whisper,
Knows our ev'ry want and need.
When we come before You, Father,
He is there to intercede.

O God, the fullness of Your presence
Occupies both time and space.
The very essence of Your being
Holds the universe in place.
We cannot comprehend Your greatness,
Cannot fathom all Your ways.
Yet we bow before You, Father,
Lifting high our Maker's praise.

SOUNDTRACK: https://wilds.org/store/product/we-come-into-your-presence/

138 JUST AS I AM

Just as I am, without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidd'st me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

139 AND CAN IT BE

And can it be that I should gain
An int'rest in the Saviour's blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?
Amazing love! How can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
Amazing love! How can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

He left His Father's throne above,
So free, so infinite His grace;
Humbled Himself in matchless love,
And bled for Adam's helpless race!
'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me!
'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me!

Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature's night;
Thine eye diffused a quick'ning ray,
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my heart was free;
I rose went forth, and followed Thee.
My chains fell off, my heart was free;
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.

No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,
Bold I approach th'eternal throne
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.
Bold I approach th'eternal throne
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.

140 CHOSEN AS HIS CHILDREN (BORN AGAIN)

(1 PETER 1 & 2)
Chosen by the Father's mercy,
Set apart to serve His Son,
Sanctified by His own Spirit-
Praise the Holy Three in One!
Saved by resurrection power,
Shielded in His faithful love;
Now, no enemy can tarnish
My inheritance above!

Chorus:
I'm born again!
I'm God's own chosen child of mercy!
Born again! What love and grace!
Father keep me walking worthy
Till I look upon Your face,
Till I look upon Your face.

Led by wisdom into suff'ring,
Grieved by many trials below,
Yet rejoicing in His purpose,
That my faith as gold may glow.
Granted faith for overcoming,
Filled with love for Christ unseen;
Even angels cannot fathom
What salvation God will bring!

Fixed upon this hope completely,
As obedient children fear;
For the Holy One who called you
Purchased you with blood so dear.
Born anew from seed eternal,
By His lovingkindness spurred,
Lay aside all tasteless yearnings-
Crave the true and living Word!

Built on Christ, the sure foundation,
We are free from guilt and shame;
He is fitting us together
As a house to praise His name!
We are chosen as God's people,
Called from darkness into light;
O what mercy now entreats us
To proclaim His glories bright!

141 VICTORY IN JESUS

I heard an old, old story,
how the Saviour came from glory,
How He gave His life on Calvary
to save a wretch like me;
I heard about His groaning,
of His precious blood's atoning,
Then I repented of my sins
and won the victory.

Chorus:
O victory in Jesus,
my Saviour forever,
He sought me and bought me
with His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him,
and all my love is due Him,
He plunged me to victory
beneath the cleansing flood.

I heard about His healing,
of His cleansing pow'r revealing.
How He made the lame to walk again
and caused the blind to see;
And then I cried, "Dear Jesus,
come and heal my broken spirit,"
And somehow Jesus came and brought
to me the victory.

I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in glory,
And I heard about the streets of gold
beyond the crystal sea;
About the angels singing,
and the old redemption story,
And some sweet day I'll sing up there
the song of victory.

142 HERE I STAND

I once was broken, marred within,
An image ruined, scarred, and stained.
I had no hope that You'd forgive
The sin that caused Your deepest pain.

Chorus:
Yet here I stand by grace complete,
Made faultless through Your precious blood.
And I'll draw near with confidence,
Assured of Your unfailing love.

You sought me in my wandering
Though I Your love could never earn.
You gave Your life an offering
And bore the wrath that I deserved.

My voice shall praise You as my King,
My perfect Lamb, and great High Priest.
And when temptations call to me,
I'll claim Your promised victory!

SOUNDTRACK: https://wilds.org/store/product/here-i-stand/

143 COME, CHRISTIANS, JOIN TO SING

Come, Christians, join to sing
Alleluia! Amen!
Loud praise to Christ our King;
Alleluia! Amen!
Let all, with heart and voice
Before His throne rejoice;
Praise is His gracious choice:
Alleluia! Amen!

Come, lift your hearts on high;
Alleluia! Amen!
Let praises fill the sky;
Alleluia! Amen!
He is our Guide and Friend;
To us He'll condescend;
His love shall never end:
Alleluia! Amen!

Praise yet our Christ again;
Alleluia! Amen!
Life shall not end the strain;
Alleluia! Amen!
On heaven's blissful shore
His goodness we'll adore,
Singing forevermore:
Alleluia! Amen!

144 ONLY BY HIS GRACE

I found grace to save my soul;
At the cross grace made me whole
When my Savior took control
And washed my sin away (sins away).
Now the fellowship is sweet
As I worship at His feet (at His feet).

Chorus:
Only by His grace (by His grace),
I have found this holy place,
Underneath His wings of love,
trusting in my God above.
Grace for every need (my need),
Grace that overflows and far exceeds,
Lavished on my soul at Calvary,
Only by His grace.

Ev'ry valley I have known,
Such compassion I've been shown.
Giving strength that's not my own,
It's only by His grace (by His grace).
Every burden that I bear,
Jesus comes and meets me there (meets me there).

145 FREE FROM GUILT, FREE FROM SIN

Dark the stain I cannot hide,
Stain of my sin my guilt to prove;
Guilt my own and foolish pride,
Pride, the reason for my sin (for my sin).
Light of God came shining down;
Son of God my soul to win,
Laid aside His heav'nly crown,
Paid the price for all my sin,
Paid the price for all my sin (all my sin).

Chorus:
Wash me in the Savior's blood;
Make me pure, without, within;
Cleanse my heart and set me free,
Free from guilt and free from sin,
Free from guilt and free from sin (free from sin).

Love of God that lights my way,
Love displayed on Calvary;
Lamb of God, my soul to save,
Gave His life to set me free (set me free)!
Gone the darkness, come the Light,
Gone the night the day begins;
Gone the wrong, my soul made right,
Free from guilt and free from sin,
Free from guilt and free from sin (free from sin)!

146 CHRIST IS SUFFICIENT

Nothing I've done could merit God's grace;
Nothing I'll do can take it away.
I have one hope in life and death:
I have been clothed in Christ's righteousness!

Chorus:
Christ is sufficient! His work is finished! 
He is my faith's Author and End;
Christ is enough- my Savior and Friend!

Nothing remains since Jesus has died;
Justice was paid; the Judge satisfied.
Great is my sin, greater His love;
I have been cleansed with Calvary's blood!

Nothing I've sought on earth satisfies;
I was designed to thirst after Christ.
Beckoned by Him, "Drink and be filled."
I am content, yet yearn for Him still.

Nothing but Christ can undo the Fall;
He will return to reign over all.
Come to us, Lord; right ev'ry wrong;
Soon the redeemed will join heaven's song.

147 THROUGH MY LIFE, LORD

Through my life, Lord, be glorified,
Through my life, Lord, be glorified,
You gave Your life for me, Sweet Lamb of Calvary,
Through my life, Lord, be glorified.

148 HIS WAY IS PERFECT

When my way seems dark and drear and the future I don't know,
My heart feels so empty as the tears unending flow.
When my heart breaks with sorrow and a tempest fills my soul,
This one thing I know for sure: my God is in control.

Chorus:
His way is perfect, His way is perfect.
Though I don't understand His wise and loving plan.
His way is perfect. His way is perfect.
Take my life and make a vessel purified.
God makes no mistakes; His way is best.

When the toils of life are come and my heart is worn with care,
I faint 'neath the burden of a cross I cannot bear.
When the joy has departed from my sorrow-stricken soul,
This one thing I know for sure: my God is in control.

SOUNDTRACK: https://wilds.org/store/product/his-way-is-perfect/

149 ALWAYS THE SAME

I am His, He is mine; Jesus knows my name.
I can rest in His arms; He's always the same.
When I fall, when I call, Jesus takes my hand.
Cleansing me, lifting me, He helps me to stand.

Chorus:
Always the same, O praise His name,
Jesus never changes; He's always the same.
Always together, His love is forever.
Jesus never changes; He's always the same.

In His love I'm secure; we shall never part.
In His Word I will trust and give Him all my heart.
In the dark of the night, when my heart would fear,
Lovingly, tenderly, my Saviour is near.

150 DAY BY DAY

Day by day and with each passing moment,
Strength I find to meet my trials here;
Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment,
I've no cause for worry or for fear.
He whose heart is kind beyond all measure,
Gives unto each day what he deems best -
Lovingly, its part of pain and pleasure,
Mingling toil with peace and rest.

Every day the Lord Himself is near me,
With a special mercy for each hour;
All my cares He fain would bear, and cheer me,
He whose name is Counsellor and Pow'r.
The protection of his child and treasure,
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
"As the days, thy strength shall be in measure,"
This the pledge to me He made.

Help me then in every tribulation,
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
That I lose not faith's sweet consolation,
Offered me within Thy holy Word.
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
E'er to take, as from a father's hand,
One by one, the days, the moment fleeting,
Till I reach the promised land.

151 I RUN TO CHRIST

I run to Christ when chased by fear
And find a refuge sure.
"Believe in me," His voice I hear;
His words and wounds secure.
I run to Christ when torn by grief
And find abundant peace.
"I too had tears," He gently speaks;
Thus joy and sorrow meet.

I run to Christ when worn by life
And find my soul refreshed.
"Come unto Me," He calls through strife;
Fatigue gives way to rest.
I run to Christ when vexed by hell
And find a mighty arm.
"The Devil flees," the Scriptures tell;
He roars, but cannot harm.

I run to Christ when stalked by sin
And find a sure escape.
"Deliver me," I cry to Him;
Temptation yields to grace.
I run to Christ when plagued by shame
And find my one defense.
"I bore God's wrath," He pleads my case-
My Advocate and Friend.

152 IT WAS FOR ME

Why leave a heav'nly mansion?
Why choose a simple stall?
Why wander poor and homeless,
The King and Lord of all?
Why heal a lonely beggar?
Why cause the blind to see?
The Light of all creation,
Shining there for me.

Chorus:
It was for me He cried, for me He died,
For me He shed His blood upon the tree.
It was for me He came, for me His shame;
For me, oh, praise His name, it was for me.

Why stay in Olive's garden?
Why spend the night in prayer?
Why suffer such betrayal,
In anguish kneeling there?
Why leave His mother crying?
Why set Barabbas free?
The spotless Lamb of heaven
Given there for me.

Why climb that dreadful mountain?
Why suffer agony?
Why give His blood a fountain spilled and broken, flowing free?
Why He walked the road to Calv'ry, gave His life so willingly,
Broken there, the Rose of Sharon died for me.

The King Who came from heaven,
To the cry, "There is no room,"
Now must lay His weary body
In a cold and borrowed tomb.
But the grave it could not hold Him;
Death lost its victory.
The risen Lord of glory is living now for me!

153 LORD, I NEED YOU

Sometimes when life seems gentle
and blessings flood my way,
I turn my gaze away from You
and soon forget to pray.
But when the sky grows darker
and courage turns to fear,
My anxious voice cries upward
with words You long to hear.

Chorus:
Lord, I need You
when the sea of life is calm.
O Lord, I need You
when the wind is blowing strong.
Whether trials come or cease,
keep me always on my knees.
Lord, I need You.
Lord, I need You.

Lord, help me to remember
I'm weak but You are strong.
I cannot sing apart from You,
for Lord, You are my song.
Although I'm prone to wander
and boast in all I do;
Lord, keep my eyes turned upward
so I depend on You.

154 ALMIGHTY, UNCHANGEABLE GOD

Who spread out the clouds before Him?
Who fashioned the earth with His hands?
Who created the starry host
And formed the earth at His command?
Who scatters lightning before Him,
commands the rain and snow to fall?
Who makes the nations tremble?
Who is Lord over all?

Chorus:
He is Almighty,
Unchangeable God (unchangeable God),
King of kings, Lord of lords,
robed in majesty.
He rules and reigns (He rules and reigns),
for all eternity,
Almighty, Unchangeable God.

He is like the light at sunrise,
like the brightness after the rain.
Robed in splendor,
He's seated on His heav'nly throne above.
His glory fills the heavens;
He is exalted over all.
Yet this God of Heaven loves me
with an everlasting love.

155 CHRIST IS ENOUGH

My sin remained a dirty stain
My good could not erase.
Then Jesus came, my sin He claimed
And cleansed me by His grace.

Chorus:
To Christ I fly! On Him rely!
His grace is all I need.
Unmoved by doubts, my faith cries out,
"Christ is enough for me!"

My crippling fears are so severe,
I stumble on my way.
Yet Jesus keeps and never sleeps;
His right hand holds me safe.

My hurting heart is torn apart
By unrelenting pain.
Still Jesus cares, my suffering shares;
His favor never fades.

My feeble might will lose the fight
Against the Devil's schemes.
But Jesus rose to crush my foe
And live His life in me.

156 SEEK YE FIRST

Seek ye first the kingdom of God 
And His righteousness,
And all these things shall be added unto you.
Allelu, alleluia!

Ask and it shall be given unto you;
Seek and ye shall find;
Knock and the door shall be opened unto you.

157 GOD SEES THE HEART

Our God measures man by a standard divine,
For He sees underneath ev'ry outward design.
He looks past possessions and costly attire;
He studies the heart- ev'ry thought and desire.

Chorus:
For the eyes of the Lord are searching to and fro.
We have no secrets that our God does not know.
Our Father knows our thoughts; He understands ev'ry part.
Man sees the outside, but God sees the heart.

Our God does not judge by how tall we may stand
Or how much we possess, Or the rank we command.
His gaze goes far deeper to things that endure;
He honors the man who keeps his heart pure.

158 GOD OF HEAVEN

God of Heaven.
God of all the earth and sky.
Great Creator, Master of all nature.
Who gives birth to snow from heaven,
Holds the waves at ocean's edge,
Gives the orders to the morning,
Shows each dawn its place to shine?
God of Heaven.
God of all the earth and sky.

God of Ages.
God who wrote the Book of Time.
Sovereign Ruler, Alpha and Omega.
Saints before, He's guided safely.
Hist'ry's pages signed by Him.
Author of our days and hours.
Things to come are held secure.
God of Ages.
Alpha and Omega.

God of Power!
God who breaks the darkness.
Righteous Warrior. Champion of His children,
Goes before us into battle.
Good and evil bow to Him.
Those in bondage freed forever.
Vict'ries won at His command!
God of Power.
Vict'ries won at His command.

God who heals us.
God who gives us peace and hope.
God who listens. Carries all our fragile
Dreams and heartaches, wins and failures.
Binds the broken, hides the weak.
New beginnings freely offered.
Who can make us whole again?
God who heals us.
God of all the earth and sky.

159 ON CHRIST I STAND

My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

Chorus:
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
A higher plane than I have found,
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand.

When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In ev'ry high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh may I then in Him be found!
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.

160 HOLY, HOLY, HOLY

Holy, holy, holy!
Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning
our song shall rise to Thee;
Holy, holy, holy!
Merciful and mighty!
God in three Persons,
blessed Trinity!

Holy, holy, holy!
All the saints adore Thee,
Casting down their golden crowns
around the glassy sea;
Cherubim and seraphim
falling down before Thee,
Which wert, and art, and
evermore shalt be.

Holy, holy, holy!
Though the darkness hide Thee,
Though the eye of sinful man
Thy glory may not see,
Only Thou art holy;
there is none beside Thee,
Perfect in pow'r, in
love, and purity.

Holy, holy, holy!
Lord God Almighty!
All Thy works shall praise Thy name,
in earth and sky and sea;
Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty!
God in three Persons blessed Trinity!

161 TREASURE OF MY HEART

You may seek for treasure rare:
You may search for gold or silver;
Fortune and fame are the wealth of this world.
There’s a story greater still
Only One can fulfill.
It's the treasure of Jesus my Lord.

Chorus:
Jesus you are the Treasure,
Treasure of my heart.
I'm amazed at Your beauty
and all that You are,
My ev'rything, the song I sing,
My sun, moon, and stars;
Jesus, You are the Treasure,
Treasure of my heart.

At the end of what we know
When we see our loving Savior,
Treasures of earth will all vanish away.
Heaven's glories we will share;
Nothing else will compare
To the treasure of Jesus my Lord.

162 CONSTRAINED BY CHRIST

The Man of sorrows died in agony,
Struck once by God for my iniquity.
He satisfied the Father’s holy wrath
And drank the bitter cup in my behalf.

Chorus:
Constrained by Christ's atoning sacrifice,
Without reserve, I offer Him my life.
Redeeming love compels me to proclaim
The all surpassing glory of His name.

Resplendent in His royal majesty,
My King still wears the scars of Calvary.
His death wounds show the depth of selfless love,
Imploring me to live for things above.

For Him I count my life no longer mine.
In His great work, a higher call I find.
To lose myself and find my all in Christ,
I follow on and gladly pay the price.

163 WHEN I SURVEY

When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my God;
All the vain things that charm me most-
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small:
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all!

SOUNDTRACK: https://wilds.org/store/product/when-i-survey/

164 HERE IS LOVE

Here is love vast as the ocean,
Loving-kindness as the flood,
When the Prince of Life, our ransom,
Shed for us His precious blood.
Who His love will not remember?
Who can cease to sing His praise?
He can never be forgotten
Throughout heav'n's eternal days.

On the mount of crucifixion,
Fountains opened, deep and wide;
Through the flood-gates of God’s mercy
Flowed a vast and gracious tide.
Grace and love like mighty rivers,
Poured incessant from above,
And God's peace and perfect justice
Kissed a guilty world in love.

Let me, all Your love accepting,
Love You, ever all my days;
Let me seek Your kingdom only,
And my life be to Your praise;
You alone shall be my glory,
Nothing in the world I see;
You have cleansed and sanctified me,
You Yourself have set me free.

In Your truth You surely guide me
By Your Spirit through Your Word;
And Your grace my need is meeting,
As I trust in You, my Lord.
Of Your fullness You are pouring
Your great love and pow'r anew,
Without measure, full and boundless,
Drawing out my heart to You.

165 HOLY IS THE LORD

Holy, holy, holy, Holy is the Lord!
Holy, holy, holy, Holy is our God!
He who always liveth, Evermore the same.
Heav'n and earth He ruleth; Come and praise His name!

Holy, holy, holy, Holy is the Lord!
Holy, holy, holy, Holy is our God!
Glorious and beloved Is the One adored,
Holy, holy, holy, Holy is the Lord.

166 CONSIDER HIM

He left His throne to wear a crown of shame,
Forsaken Son when He our sin became.
In blackest night, He faced His death alone.
In brightest day, He rose and claimed His throne.

Chorus:
Consider Him who chose a lonely cross.
Consider Him and marvel at His loss.
Despising shame, Christ suffered in your place.
Consider Him, sufficient is His grace.

Though in the race of faith you seek relief,
Reset your gaze on Him who knows your grief.
Rejected by the ones He came to save,
Without complaint, His sacred life He gave.

All those who long to be like Jesus Christ
Must now partake in His self-sacrifice.
Take up your cross, endure the struggle now.
In time you'll learn the cross leads to the crown.

SOUNDTRACK: https://wilds.org/store/product/consider-him/

167 IT'S STILL THE CROSS

The lonely night, the agony,
The crying in Gethsemane.
The Lord of life would face His death
And willingly God's wrath accept.

Chorus:
It's still the cross, its's till the blood;
It's still His dying act of love
Compelling me to spend my life
In giving ev'rything for Christ,
In giving ev'rything for Christ.

The Roman scourge, the mockery,
The hanging curse of Calvary.
The Lord of life pursued His death;
And satisfied the sinner's debt.

The brilliant light, the stone removed,
The echo of His empty tomb.
The Lord of life had banished death;
Its fatal sting a vacant threat.

The greatest love, the sacrifice,
The triumph of the cross of Christ.
The Lord of life demands my death
To live for Him with ev'ry breath.

SOUNDTRACK: https://wilds.org/store/product/its-still-the-cross/

168 GOD OF GRACE

O God of grace, You gave me peace,
A peace with You to end our war.
My sin had made us enemies;
I loved my ways and hated Yours.
Though my rebel soul was vile,
Through Christ I now am reconciled.
I once a foe don't comprehend
How, God of grace, You call me friend.

Chorus:
God of love, God of grace,
On the cross You took my place.
Now I lift my voice in praise to You.

O God of grace, You gave me life
When I was dead and sin depraved.
But for those sins my Savior died,
Nailed to the cross; my debt was paid.
Eternal God, You never die,
Christ as man I crucified.
You died for me so now I live,
O God of grace, new life You give.

O God of grace, You gave me love,
A love for You above all else.
So now I battle earthly lust
And fight to kill my love for self.
Because in Christ I have been raised,
I'll pursue You all my days
And fix my gaze on Christ above.
O God of grace, You are my love!

169 MY GOD IS NEAR

Make me know Your presence, Lord,
the King of glory here.
You know each thought and action,
hope, anxiety and fear.
How can I hide from Thee?
Can darkness hide iniquity?
Oh, how can I unfaithful be,
when You are very near (are near) to me?

Chorus:
When God is near (is near),
all the world seems far away.
When God is near (is near),
every fear is set aside.
When God is near (is near),
how can I stray, how can I falter?
I'll stay upon the altar.
I know my God is near!

Make me know Your presence, Lord,
when I feel so alone.
You know each trial and testing,
pain, the hurt that is "unknown."
Oh, why can I not see
Your hand so firmly guiding me?
Oh how can I untrusting be,
when You are very near (are near) to me?

SOUNDTRACK: https://wilds.org/store/product/my-god-is-near/

170 I AM WEAK BUT YOU ARE STRONG

Lord, I come with nothing to offer You.
In my hands no gift I bring.
All I have, my pride and my selfishness.
All I want is You as my King.

Chorus:
In my weakness now I come, Lord.
Be my strength, and be my song.
In my need I seek Your help, Lord.
I am weak, but You are strong.

Give me strength, dear Lord, to obey Your Word
As I take the shield of faith.
I receive Your gift of salvation.
I rejoice in the gift of Your grace.

171 MY GOD IS A RIGHTEOUS GOD

Jesus knows my every word and deed;
Jesus longs to meet my deepest need.
He lives now to intercede-
He will surely stand by me.

Chorus:
My God is a righteous God;
My God is a holy God.
My God is a faithful God;
He will surely stand by me.

Jesus' love has drawn my heart to Him;
Jesus' blood has washed away my sin.
His Word makes me pure within;
He will surely stand by me.

Christ has saved me from sin's penalty;
Christ will keep me for eternity.
He guides through life's stormy sea-
He will surely stand by me.

Only God can move a mountain;
Only God can calm the sea.
Only God can heal a wounded spirit;
Only God, only God!

Chorus:
God Almighty, Most holy, wise God;
You are the power and the glory,
O God, our God!

Only God can hear my heart's cry;
Only God, my sin atone.
Only God can give us calm assurance,
Only God, only God!

Only God can be a refuge;
Only God can be our strength.
Only God will stand as our Defender,

Only God in majesty!
Only God will reign as King forever,
Only God, only God!

173 SING THE GREATNESS OF OUR GOD

Sing the greatness of our God,
the Uncreated One.
He designed the universe
and lit the blazing sun.
Countless stars and galaxies
He painted in the sky.
Nature shouts the awesome pow'r
of God Who reigns on high.

Chorus:
Sing the greatness of our God,
With heart and soul and voice!
Sing the greatness of our God,
Let Heav'n and Earth rejoice!

Sing the greatness of our God,

He speaks and it is done.
There is no one like our God,
Against Him, who can stand?
He controls our destiny,
and all the ways of man.

Sing the greatness of our God,
the everlasting One.
He transcends both time and space
from His eternal throne.
No beginning, without end,
our minds cannot conceive.
God, the ever-living One,
in whom we live and breathe.

174 SEE THE CHRIST

See the Christ, the Son divine,
One with God before all time,
Lay aside His robe of light,
Clutching not His equal right.
See Him as a servant born,
Taking on our human form.
Make His humble mind your own;
Serve your brothers here below.

See the Christ, the son of Man,
In obedience to God's plan,
Take for us a sinner's death,
Gasping out His final breath.
See Him on the cross of blood,
Provoking there His love for God.
Trust the Father with your life;
He will turn all wrongs to right.

See the Christ, the Son, alive,
In His radiant place above,
Now exalted, raised on high,
Reigning from the Father's side.
See Him take the greatest name:
Lord of All, by God proclaimed.
Hail Him King, and bow the knee
For the Father's glory.

175 MORE LOVE TO THEE

More love to Thee, O Christ,
more love to Thee!
Hear Thou the prayer I make
On bended knee;
This is my earnest plea:

Chorus:
More love, O Christ, to Thee,
More love to Thee,
More love to Thee!

Once earthly joy I craved,
Sought peace and rest;
Now Thee alone I seek,
Give what is best;
This all my prayer shall be:

Then shall my latest breath
Whisper Thy praise;
This be the parting cry
My heart shall raise;
This still its prayer shall be:

176 YOUR LIVING WORD

Declaring Your redemptive plan

alive and ever new.

Your all-sufficient Word, O God,
sustains the feeble heart,
Revealing Your empow'ring grace
that bids all fears departed.
The judgements of Your holy Word

Directed by Your sov'reign hand
and worthy of our trust,
and worthy of our trust.

177 COME, MY SOUL, WITH EVERY CARE

Come, my soul, with every care;
Jesus loves to answer prayer.
He Himself bids you to pray
And will never turn away.
You are coming to your King-
Large petitions with you bring,
For His grace and pow'r are such,
None can ever ask too much.

With my burden I begin:
Lord, remove this load of sin;
Let Your blood, for sinners spilt,
Set my conscience free from guilt.
Lord, Your rest to me impart;
Take possession of my heart.
There Your blood-bought right maintain
And without a rival reign.

While I am a pilgrim here,
Let Your love my spirit cheer;
As my Guide, my Guard, my Friend,
Lead me to my journey’s end.
Show me what I am to do;
Ev'ry hour my strength renew.
I would have Your will, not mine;
For it's perfect, good, and kind.

He loves me so, He's so good to me.

He answers prayer, He answers prayer,
He answers prayer, He's so good to me.

I'll do His will, I'll do His will,
I'll do His will, He's so good to me.

I'll change for Him, I'll change for Him,
I'll change for Him, He's so good to me.

179 HIS WONDROUS LOVE

It was down at the feet of Jesus,
O the blessed, happy day!
That my soul found peace in believing,
And my sins were all washed away.

Chorus:
Let me tell the old, old story
Of His grace so full and free,
Let my heart keep giving Him the glory
For His wondrous love to me,
For His wondrous love to me.

It was down at the feet of Jesus,
Where I found such perfect rest.
Where the light first dawned on my spirit,
And my soul was truly blest.

It was down at the feet of Jesus,
Where I brought my guilt and sin,
Where He paid my debt and forgave me,
For He died my soul to win.

Crucified and risen to redeem us,
We adore and worship Him alone.

We are Your church, Your bride,
the people of Your name.
In Your strength we live; 
we worship, unashamed,
For Your cause we serve;
we joyfully proclaim
We are Your people;
we are Your church.

Set apart to serve our loving Savior,
Given pow'r to share redemption's plan-
We will tell the world the love of Jesus;
We will preach the cross to ev'ry land.

With a shout, the Bridegroom is returning.
Heaven's Prince will come to claim His own.
We will rise to reign with Him forever;
We will sing our praise around His throne.

181 GOD'S LOVE NEVER FAILS

God's love never fails, 
proved on the cross.
Open arms of love,
nailed there for us.

Chorus:
God's love never fails.
He is faithful through the storm.
Though the waves are high,
He is by my side.
God's love never fails.

God's love is enough,
through ev'ry change.
When all fades away,
His love remains.

God's love will prevail,
though sin seems strong.
By God's sacrifice,
sin's chains are gone.

182 THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD

Sin grips the heart within-
A curse on fallen men.
This pride and selfishness we hold inside.
Though we were all condemned,
We had a loving Friend
who came to save us (to save us).

Chorus:
The greatest story ever told is of this Jesus,
How He came to earth to rescue sinful man,
Sent from the Father up above
To sacrifice in love and take our place-
And give unending grace.

He lived a perfect life
And gave the blind their sight,
Fulfilled the things foretold by prophesy.
He humbly took His cross
And died to save the lost,
their sins forgiven (forgiven).

This Son of God who gave
His life and took the grave
Obeyed His Father’s will despite the cost.
But death could not contain
His pow'r, His love, His grace,
for He is risen (is risen)!

The greatest story ever told is of this Jesus
How He came to earth to rescue sinful man
Sent from the Father up above to sacrifice in love
And take our place and give unending grace

183 YOU ARE THE CHRIST

In the beginning, in the form of God,
With just a word You sang creation's song,
But when by sin humanity was marred,
You took on flesh to save a world gone wrong.

Chorus:
You are the Christ, Son of the living God;
My rebel heart in mercy You pursued.
No other name deserves my praise;
You are my life, my all, and I belong to You!

At Calvary, the soldiers chose the nails
to fasten You upon the cruel tree.
The hammer drove into Your sinless hands
The nails You chose to pay sin's penalty

Triumphantly prevailing over hell,
You broke sin's curse by rising from the dead.
Parading captives forth in victory,
You freed my soul and crushed the serpent's head.

And when one day redemption is complete,
I gaze at last upon Your face unveiled;
My voice shall echo through eternity,
"In spite of me, Your saving grace prevailed!"

Make my life a vessel cleansed by grace!

Sanctify my will, that I glorify Your name.
Occupy my all, that I worship You with ev'ry part.

Keep my soul from the evils that surround me.
May my lips exalt You more each day!

O God of Peace, I look to You
though darkness fills my eyes;
For in my deepest pain and loss,
You never leave my side.
My weary heart finds perfect peace
when resting in Your shade.
Beneath the shadow of the cross
my anxious heart is stayed.

O God of Peace, I rest in You
through pain that You allow;
For You have been my strong defense;
Lord, be my comfort now.
You carry me through times of doubt
when weakness grips my soul.
My troubled heart would yield to You
and rest in Your control.

O God of Peace, I look to You
and glory in Your cross;
For there You claimed my thirsty soul;
You took my pain and loss.
My quickened heart is satisfied
in You and You alone.
My soul shall praise the King of kings,
the Christ, my Lord, my own!

Sealed my pardon with His blood:
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!

Guilty, vile and helpless, we;
Spotless Lamb of God was He:
Full atonement! Can it be?
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!

Lifted up was He to die;

188 GOD'S REFINING FIRE

O Lord, we pray, "Thy will be done,"
Or "Master, here am I."
We pray You'd do a mighty work
That to the flesh we'd die.
And when the answer comes to us
In form of trial and test,
We fail to see Your loving hand,
Refining fire is best.

Chorus:
God's refining fire,
God's refining fire (refining fire).
May it purge me now and make of me what You require.
O Lord, feed the fire,
Your refining fire (refining fire).
Now as gold and silver must be tried,
Lord, may my heart be purified.
Lord, send Your great refining fire.

That I may stand when You appear,
Abide till Your return.
O place the fire perfectly
That all the dross be burned.
Whether furnace of affliction, Lord,
Or unfulfilled desire,
Bring forth a vessel pure and tried
By Your refining fire.

Where can I find hope in all the trials that You bring?
How can I have joy while suff'ring loss?
When my soul's in prison how can I find cause to sing?
How did You find peace while on the cross?

Chorus:
Though I may never understand, I'll trust with all my heart.
And from the course that You have planned I never want to part.
In searching for Your way and wisdom, teach me if You would,
That for all time, in ev'ry place, my God is good.

How can You give pardon to a life that's full of sin?
Where is there a refuge from my cares?
Is there any healing for a void that lies within,
When silence is Your answer to my prayers?

To the end of the world and age,
We will follow Christ our Lord!"

Lose your life, your home, your brother-
Gain them for eternity!

Christ has sent us to the nations:
"Call the lost to follow Me."
Reach the sinner; preach salvation;
Teach the things you've heard and seen.

From His throne beyond the skies:

Follow me to paradise."

All tribes and tongues assembled are,
Among Thy chosen will I be,
At thy right hand, complete in Thee.

193 RISE UP AGAIN

Though sin has beset you and taken control,
Though Satan's great strongholds stand fast in your soul,
Whatever your failure, though great be your fall,
God's mercy and pardon are offered to all.

Chorus:
Rise up again. Take back the ground.
Turn from your sin and let grace abound.
Press toward the prize; the victory you'll win.
Forget things behind you and rise up again.

Let's seek those who've fallen from grace to restore
And show them God's mercies forever endure.
In spite of our past our Lord uses us still,
And works it for good in the course of His will.

194 JESUS, THE SON OF GOD

Jesus is the Son of God, the Lord of all,
The chosen One, the Son of Man,
The King of kings who gave His life for me-
This Jesus, the Great "I AM"!

Chorus:
We bow down before Him who is worthy of worship,
Worthy of worship and praise.
We bow down before and humbly adore,
This Jesus, the Son of God.

Jesus is the Lamb of God, the Righteous One,
The Sacrifice who bore my sin,
The Prince of Life who lives and reigns on high-
This Jesus, He's coming again!

195 LORD, KEEP MY FOCUS ON YOU

Sometimes I live my life just as You've planned.
Other times I struggle to obey Your commands.
Choices I make each day determine if I obey
And follow You, trusting You. Guide me I pray.

Chorus:
Lord, keep my focus on You each day
Though I am tempted to go my own way.
Help me to trust in You,
to live my life, to honour You.
Lord, keep my focus on You.

Trials surround me, Lord, I cry in despair.
Though I know You're with me and You hear ev'ry prayer.
Open my eyes to see that You know what's best for me.
You're ever near. Calm my fear. This is my plea.

Humbly I follow You, sharing Your Word,
Praising You, Lord Jesus, for Your love unreserved.
Guide me to do Your will, to reach those in darkness still.
A shining light, burning bright, Your plan fulfill.

196 BLESSED ASSURANCE

Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
O what a foretaste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.

Chorus:
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all the day long;
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Saviour all the day long.

Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
Angels descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

Perfect submission, all is at rest,
I in my Saviour am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.

197 I LOVE YOU, LORD

I thank You, Lord, for all You've done,
I don't deserve Your love;
When I was lost You saw my need,
And left Your home above.

Refrain:
I love You, Lord, I love You, Lord,
because of Calvary;
I love You, Lord, I love You, Lord,
You're everything to me.

You proved Your love on Calvary,
You bore my sin and shame;
I'll live for You through all my days,
I'll praise Your holy name!

198 PRESS ON

There's a course that must be finished,
there's a race that must be run.
There's a mission to accomplish,
and a battle to be won!
We've been called to take the challenge
by God's might and through His Son;
He will give us grace to complete the race,
moving forward, pressing on.

Chorus:
Toward the hope of our high calling,
toward the promise we've received,
With the strength that we've been given,
pressing on to victory!
And toward the One who's run before us,
as we lay each weight aside,
Till the race is run, 'til the prize is won,
'til we reach the finish line, press on!

There's a faithful cloud of witnesses
who inspire us in our task.
They have fought the fight,
they have run the race,
they have won the crown at last!
And the lives they've lived remind us
though the race at times seems long,
God will give the grace to complete the race,
And the courage to press on.

199 O GOD, MY JOY

O God, my joy, You reign above
in radiant splendor and beauty.
Your Word has drawn my heart to love
the awesome sight of Your glory.
Your blazing light and gospel grace
shine brightly from my Savior’s face.
No other wonder would I see
than Christ enthroned in His glory!

Sustained by joy in trial and pain,
I trust Your wisdom and mercy.
Through suff'ring that Your love ordains,
more like Your Son You will make me.
For Christ embraced the cross of shame,
beholding glorious joys to come.
O give me faith like His to see
that suff'ring lifts me to glory!

Compelled by joy, I fight the sin
that turns my gaze from Your glory.
Your Holy Spirit dwells within;
His presence arms me for vict'ry.
Let death and hell against me rise;
through death I’ll gain eternal joys.
All pow'rs of hell will bend the knee
before my great King of Glory!

200 GAZE ON THE CHRIST

Behold the Lamb, the spotless Lamb,
Who takes away our sin;
The debt we faced was not erased,
But paid in full by Him.

Chorus:
Gaze on the Christ, our sacrifice
On altar made of wood.
Exalt the Lamb, the worthy Lamb,
Who bought us with His blood.

Behold the Lamb, the bleeding Lamb,
Who takes away the veil;
His body torn, His soul forlorn,
Christ cut to God a trail.

Behold the Lamb, the dying Lamb,
Who takes away just wrath;
God saw the blood of His beloved
And over us has passed.

Behold the Lamb, the risen Lamb,
Who takes away death’s sting;
All knees shall bend, all praise ascend
To Christ, the living King.

201 THE POWER OF HIS RISING

I want to know Christ
And the pow'r of His rising,
Share in His sacrifice,
Conform to His death.
As I pour out my life
To be filled with His Spirit,
Joy follows suffering,
And life follows death.

202 MY JESUS, FAIR

My Jesus, fair, was pierced by thorns,
By thorns grown from the fall.
Thus He who gave the curse was torn
To end that curse for all.

Chorus:
O love divine, O matchless grace-
That God should die for men!
With joyful grief I lift my praise,
Abhorring all my sin, adoring only Him.

My Jesus, meek, was scorned by men,
By men in blasphemy.
"Father, forgive their senseless sin!"
He prayed, for them, for me.

My Jesus, kind, was torn by nails,
By nails of cruel men.
And to His cross, as grace prevailed,
God pinned my wretched sin.

My Jesus, pure, was crushed by God,
By God, in judgment just.
The Father grieved, yet turned His rod
On Christ, made sin for us.

My Jesus, strong, shall come to reign,
To reign in majesty.
The Lamb arose, and death is slain.
Lord, come in victory!

203 TAKE MY LIFE, AND LET IT BE

Take my life and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
Take my moments and my days,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

Take my hands and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love;
Take my feet and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee,
Swift and beautiful for Thee.

Take my voice and let me sing
Always, only for my King;
Take my lips and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee,
Filled with messages from Thee.

Take my silver and my gold,
Not a mite would I withhold:
Take my intellect and use
Ev'ry pow'r as Thou shalt choose,
Ev'ry pow'r as Thou shalt choose.

Take my will and make it Thine;
It shall be no longer mine:
Take my heart, it is Thine own;
It shall be Thy royal throne,
It shall be Thy royal throne.

Take my love, my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure store:
Take myself and I will be
Ever, only, all for Thee,
Ever, only, all for Thee.

204 FOUNTAIN OF GRACE

Fountain of grace at Calvary,
the Son of God has died for me.
Grace undeserved so full and free,
this fount of grace has rescued me.

Chorus:
A fount of grace God now provides
To all who turn to Jesus Christ.
Hearts cleansed by faith, then, Spirit filled,
Equal they stand at Calv'ry's hill.

And to this fount each day I go,
confessing sin he already knows;
And in His grace he pardons me-
this fount of grace keeps cleansing me.

Fountain of grace for others, too,
but in my pride I them refuse.
I lift myself above their state,
and scorn to share this fount of grace.

O Lord, to You in shame I bow,
hypocrisy confessing now;
I revel in grace shown to me,
yet hold it back from those in need.

This fount of grace from Calvary
is free to all, not just to me;
So how can I this grace deny
to someone else's desp'rate cry?

205 MY FAITH LOOKS UP TO THEE

My faith looks up to Thee,
Thou Lamb of Calvary, Saviour divine!
Now hear me while I pray, Take all my guilt away,
O let me from this day be wholly Thine!

May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart, my zeal inspire;
As Thou hast died for me, O may my love to Thee
Pure, warm, and changeless be, A living fire.

While life's dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread, Be Thou my Guide;
Bid darkness turn to day, Wipe sorrow's tears away,
Nor let me ever stray From Thee aside.

206 IN FAITH I FOLLOW

In faith I follow on the path, 
though the way is hid from view.
My soul is trusting in Your will,
I gladly lean on You.
Lead me on, loving Shepherd,
I rest in all You are.
Keep my gaze on only You, Lord;
strengthen now my fainting heart.

In faith I follow on the path,
though I'm worn by fear and care.
Refresh me with unending joy
to lift me from despair.
Lead me on, loving Shepherd;
my Refuge and my Shield.
Keep my gaze on only You, Lord;
to Your will my soul doth yield.

In faith I follow on the path,
'neath the shadow of the cross.
You freely gave so I could live,
I count all gain as loss.
Lead me on, loving Shepherd;
I kneel before Your throne.
Keep my gaze on only You, Lord;
my life is not my own.

In faith I follow on the path-
soon I'll see You face to face.
In times of pain I need Your strength
to finish strong the race.
Lead me on, loving Shepherd;
affliction I will bear.
Keep my gaze on only You, Lord,
glory comes beyond compare.

207 YOUR WILL BE OUR GOD

We once were not Your people,
and You were not our God.
Like sheep without a shepherd,
not knowing we were lost.
We wandered through dark valleys,
our battered souls were weak;
Then You came on a mission
to rescue scattered sheep.

Chorus:
You will be our God, and You are God alone.
We will be Your people that You will not disown.
You will be our God, and You are God alone.
We will be Your people and You are God alone.

We once were not Your people,
and You were not our God.
Like orphans with no Father,
not knowing we were loved.
We hungered for affection;
yet pushed away Your hand.
Then You chose to adopt us;
we're children of "I AM."

We once were not Your people,
and You were not our God.
Like rebels with no ruler,
yet captive to our lust.
Then You became our Master!
Our King is King of kings.
You reign as King forever,
we worship and we sing:

208 MY FAITHFUL LOVE

Beloved one, most precious in My eyes,
I see your scars and hear your wounded cries.
These tattered hands have caught your ev'ry tear;
I share your pain- your suff'ring draws Me near.

Chorus:
For I still know the plans I have for you,
And I will lead you in the way I choose.
Trust now My heart- My grace is still enough.
Forever rest within My faithful love.

Forgiven one, lift up your broken gaze
And dare to live in My restoring grace.
My blood atones for all your sinful shame;
I favor you because of My great name.

Believing one, hold fast so patiently
Onto the hope made sure at Calvary.
One day you'll see this life is not in vain;
I am the King! I'll soon return to reign.

In my life, Lord, be glorified, be glorified.
In my life, Lord, be glorified today.

In my song, Lord, be glorified, be glorified.
In my son, Lord, be glorified today.

In Your Church, Lord, be glorified, be glorified.
In Your Church, Lord, be glorified today.
