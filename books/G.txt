1 ALL MY BOAST IS IN JESUS

What wonder of wonders, what love is this
That Christ would die for me
His goodness, His merit, His righteousness
This sinner's only plea

O foolish pride, be crucified
The work is finished

All my boast is in Jesus
All my hope is His love
And I will glory forever
In what the cross has done

Now fully forgiven, my life is filled
With graces undeserved
For mercy that flowed down that sacred hill
Let praises now return

Rise up, my soul, and bless the Lord
Who else is worthy?

All my boast is in Jesus
All my hope is His love
And I will glory forever
In what the cross has done

O praise the One forever blessed
Him alone my heart adores
And I will boast in nothing less
Than the love of Christ, my Lord

O praise the One forever blessed
Him alone my heart adores
Oh, and I will boast in nothing less
Than the love of Christ, my Lord

I boast not in riches, in strength, or might
But in the grace of God
I glory in weakness, to live is Christ
In plenty or in want

That I may know, that all may see
His pow'r within me

All my boast is in Jesus
All my hope is His love
And I will glory forever
In what the cross has done

Now I stand in this freedom
Ransomed, clean in His sight
Oh, and I cannot be ashamed for

My boast is Jesus Christ
My boast is Jesus Christ
Forever my boast is Jesus Christ

2 MEDLEY: LIFT HIGH THE NAME OF JESUS/HOME ON THE OTHER SIDE

Lift high the name of Jesus,
Of Jesus our King.
Make known the power of His grace,
The beauty of His peace.
Remember how His mercy reached
And we cried out to Him.
He lifted us to solid ground,
To freedom from our sin.
Chorus
Oh sing my soul,
And tell all He's done,
Till the earth and heavens are filled with His glory!
Lift high the name of Jesus,
Of Jesus our Lord.
His power in us is greater than,
Is greater than this world.
To share the reason for our hope,
To serve with love and grace,
That all who see Him shine through us
Might bring the Father praise.
Chorus
Lift high the name of Jesus,
Of Jesus our Light.
No other name on earth can save,
Can raise a soul to life.
He opens up our eyes to see
The harvest He has grown.
We labor in His fields of grace
As He leads sinners home.
Chorus

3 IS HE WORTHY?

Do you feel the world is broken? We do
Do you feel the shadows deepen? We do

But do you know that all the dark won't stop the light from getting through? We do
Do you wish that you could see it all made new? We do

Is all creation groaning? It is
Is a new creation coming? It is
Is the glory of the Lord to be the light within our midst? It is
Is it good that we remind ourselves of this? It is

CHORUS
Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He is David's Root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory?
Is He worthy of this? He is

Does the Father truly love us? He does
Does the Spirit move among us? He does
And does Jesus our Messiah hold forever those He loves? He does
Does our God intend to dwell again with us? He does

CHORUS
Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He is David's Root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave
From ev'ry people and tribe
Ev'ry nation and tongue
He has made us a kingdom and priests to God to reign with the Son
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory?
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Is He worthy of this? He is

Is He worthy? Is He worthy? He is
He is

4 THERE IS ONE GOSPEL

There is one Gospel on which I stand
For all eternity
It is my story, my Father's plan
The Son has rescued me
Oh what a Gospel, Oh what a peace
My highest joy and my deepest need
Now and forever He is my light
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

There is one Gospel to which I cling
All else I count as loss
For there, where justice and mercy meet
He saved me on the cross
No more I boast in what I can bring
No more I carry the weight of sin
For He has brought me from death to life
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

There is one Gospel where hope is found
The empty tomb still speaks
For death could not keep my Saviour down
He lives and I am free
Now on my Saviour, I fix my eyes
My life is His and His hope is mine!
For He has promised I, too, will rise
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

And in this Gospel the church is one
We do not walk alone
We have His Spirit as we press on
To lead us safely home
And when in glory still I will sing
Of this old story that rescued me
Praise to my Saviour, the King of life
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ

5 IN CHRIST ALONE (FEATURING CITYALIGHT)

In Christ alone my hope is found;
He is my light, my strength, my song;
This cornerstone, this solid ground,
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.
What heights of love, what depths of peace,
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
My comforter, my all in all--
Here in the love of Christ I stand.

In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,
Fullness of God in helpless babe!
This gift of love and righteousness,
Scorned by the ones He came to save.
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied;
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid--
Here in the death of Christ I live.

There in the ground His body lay,
Light of the world by darkness slain;
Then bursting forth in glorious day,
Up from the grave He rose again!
And as He stands in victory,
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me;
For I am His and He is mine--
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.

No guilt in life, no fear in death--
This is the pow'r of Christ in me;
From life's first cry to final breath,
Jesus commands my destiny.
No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,
Can ever pluck me from His hand;
Till He returns or calls me home--
Here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand.

6 I SET MY HOPE (HYMN FOR A DECONSTRUCTING FRIEND)

When this life of trials tests my faith
I set my hope on Jesus
When the questions come and doubts remain
I set my hope on Jesus

For the deepest wounds that time won't heal
There's a joy that runs still deeper
There's a truth that's more than all I feel
I set my hope on Jesus

I set my hope on Jesus
My rock, my only trust
Who set His heart upon me first
I set my hope on Jesus

Though I falter in this war with sin
I set my hope on Jesus
When I fail the fight and sink within
I set my hope on Jesus

Though the shame would drown me in its sea
And I dread the waves of justice
I will cast my life on Calvary
I set my hope on Jesus

I set my hope on Jesus
My rock, my only trust
Who set His heart upon me first
I set my hope on Jesus

Though the world call me to leave my Lord
I set my hope on Jesus
Though it offer all its vain rewards
I set my hope on Jesus

Though this heart of mine is prone to stray
Give me grace enough to finish
'Till I worship on that final day
I set my hope on Jesus

I set my hope on Jesus
My rock, my only trust
Who set His heart upon me first
I set my hope on Jesus

I set my hope on Jesus
My rock, my only trust
Who set His heart upon me first
I set my hope on Jesus
I set my hope on Jesus

7 LET THE NATIONS BE GLAD

Let the glory of the Lord forever be our joy
May redemption be the theme of our song
For by grace we have been saved
And by grace we shall proclaim
To the corners of the earth that Christ is come

Chorus
Let the nations be glad
Let the people rejoice
For salvation belongs to our God
Let the whole earth be filled
With the praises of the Lord
For salvation belongs to our God
Let the nations be glad

Verse 2
Through the ages gone before
through the trial and the sword
Many saints and martyrs conquered
though they died
Still we holding out the cross
Crossing oceans suffering loss
Shall endure all things to win the crown of life

Verse 3
As Your holy church goes forth
in the Holy Spirit's power
With the glories of the gospel to exclaim
Now we pray "Your Kingdom come"
And we pray "Your will be done"
For the honor and glory of Your name

8 HOW LONG, O LORD

O God, who hears our prayers
When will your kingdom come?
With souls weighed down with cares
We call to you alone
Our path is dimmed by tears
Our world cries out in pain
We long for heaven's peace
Deliver us, again.

**Chorus**
How Long, O Lord, till you make things right?
How Long, O Lord, till our faith is sight?
How Long, O Lord, till your kingdom comes?
Lord Jesus, come

When will the sick be healed?
When will our sadness end?
When will your light reveal
The beauty of your plan?
When will our hatred cease?
When will your justice reign?
When will your enemies
Revere your holy name?

**Chorus**

You surely know our grief
Our sorrows you endured
Your Spirit intercedes
With groans too deep for words
Now make us sure in hope
Steadfast until the end
We wait upon you, Lord
And trust your sovereign hand

**Chorus x2**

9 CHRIST IS MINE FOREVERMORE

Mine are days that God has numbered
I was made to walk with Him
Yet I look for worldly treasure
And forsake the King of kings
But mine is hope in my Redeemer
Though I fall, His love is sure
For Christ has paid for every failing
I am His forevermore

Mine are tears in times of sorrow
Darkness not yet understood
Through the valley I must travel
Where I see no earthly good
But mine is peace that flows from Heaven
And the strength in times of need
I know my pain will not be wasted
Christ completes his work in me

Mine are days here as a stranger
Pilgrim on a narrow way
One with Christ I will encounter
Harm and hatred for His name
But mine is armor for this battle
Strong enough to last the war
And He has said He will deliver
Safely to the golden shore

And mine are keys to Zion city
Where beside the King I walk
For there my heart has found its treasure
Christ is mine forevermore

Come rejoice now, O my soul
For His love is my reward
Fear is gone and hope is sure
Christ is mine forevermore

Come rejoice now, O my soul
For His love is my reward
Fear is gone and hope is sure
Christ is mine forevermore

Come rejoice now, O my soul
For His love is my reward
Fear is gone and hope is sure
Christ is mine forevermore

And mine are keys to Zion city
Where beside the King I walk
For there my heart has found its treasure
Christ is mine forevermore
Christ is mine forevermore
Christ is mine forevermore

10 PRECIOUS LOVE

There is forgiveness flowing down
From where the Savior died
The Son of man upon the tree
Exchanging death for life
See Him there in innocence
The body and the blood
Behold the King, crucified
Spotless lamb of God

**Chorus**
Oh the precious love of Jesus
Oh the fount of grace divine
Flowing as a mighty river
Washing sinners in its tide
There will never be another
In whose name we are redeemed
Oh the precious love of Jesus
Pouring out for you and me

Sin and death crushed underneath
The weight of nailed pierced hands
He plundered hell and tore the veil
As creation held its breath
Then on the morning of the third
The Son began to rise
Up from the grave, victorious
Hallelujah, He's alive

**Chorus**

He is worthy
He is worthy
Worthy is the Lamb
Sing forever
Hallelujah
Worthy is the Lamb

He is worthy
He is worthy
Worthy is the Lamb
Sing forever
Hallelujah
Worthy is the Lamb

**Chorus x2**

11 OUR GOD WILL GO BEFORE US (LIVE FROM SINGAPORE)

Our God will go before us
And guide us by His presence
What confidence this promise is
We will never walk alone

Through unknown paths, through shadows
Our hearts fear not tomorrow
For every step His faithfulness
Is the truth that lights our way

**Chorus**
Our God will go before us
The Lord of Hosts is with us
O praise the One who leads us on
For His grace will bring us home

Though evil forms against us
All heaven will defend us
The gates of hell shall not prevail
For the battle is the Lord's

**Chorus**

Now send us with Your presence
And lead us on to heaven
Where songs of sorrow strain no more
And our every breath is praise
O let our every breath be praise

**Chorus**

For His grace will bring us home

12 MY SOUL WILL WAIT / MI ALMA ESPERARA

When the enemy surrounds and my heart grows faint within
When the darkness overwhelms and my fears are pressing in
I will trust in You, O Lord, in the silence I will wait
I will stand upon Your Word

You're my solid rock and my salvation
My steadfast hope that won't be shaken
My soul will wait, my soul will wait for You

Tu, mi Salvacion, mi fortaleza
Esperanza fiel y roca eterna
Mi alma, oh Dios, esperara por Ti

Tu, mi escudo y proteccion, en peligro y tempestad
Si prospera el pecador, como un soplo pasara
Yo se bien que triunfaras, Satanas vencido esta
Tu poder me guardara

You're my solid rock and my salvation
My steadfast hope that won't be shaken
My soul will wait, my soul will wait for You

You're my comfort when I feel forsaken
My refuge and my sure foundation
My soul will wait, my soul will wait for You

This is love I can't explain, this is mercy unreserved
Through Your sacrifice so great, I have peace that's undeserved
For the battle has been won, and I fear no shame or loss
Now the sting of death is gone

Tu mi salvacion, mi fortaleza
Esperanza fiel y roca eterna
Mi alma, oh Dios, esperara por Ti

En mi soledad, tu, mi consuelo
Refugio fiel, mi fundamento
Mi alma, oh Dios, esperara por Ti

Derramamos nuestras almas
Ante Ti, Senor
Confiaremos en tu gracia
Nuestro Salvador

Pouring out our hearts before You
We will trust in You
Perfect Savior, strong defender
We will trust in You

13 CONFESSIO

God of ages past
You have been our dwelling
We are but a mist
You are everlasting

CONFESSIO: VERSE 1
I, a sinner, know for certain
Before I humbly cry
I was like an old stone lying
Deep in the boggy mire
Then He who is
Almighty Came in mercy and raised me up
High upon a wall He lifted me
Least deserving of His love
We go homeward
Christ, be with us as we go
We go homeward
Christ, be with us on the road

Then from here, my voice will lift high
Rejoicing in the Lord
For His favor in this present life
And the one forevermore
The mind of man can't measure
What the Lord has done for us
I have found no other treasure
Than the Savior, our true Sun

We go homeward
Christ, be with us as we go
We go homeward
Christ, be with us on the road

He's the Way for those who wander
And the hope of those who toil
Giving strength that will not waver
On the journey to Heaven's soil
The Savior of the earth below
The Father's pure delight
The abundance of the Holy Ghost
Our eternal stream of life

We go homeward
Christ, be with us as we go
We go homeward
Christ, be with us on the road
We go homeward
Christ, be with us as we go
We go homeward
Christ, be with us on the road

14 THIS IS MY FATHER'S WORLD

This is my Father's world,
And to my listening ears
All nature sings, and round me rings
The music of the spheres.
This is my Father's world:
I rest me in the thought
Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas-
His hand the wonders wrought.
This is my Father's world:
The birds their carols raise,
The morning light, the lily white,
Declare their Maker's praise.
This is my Father's world:
He shines in all that's fair;
In the rustling grass I hear Him pass,
He speaks to me everywhere.
This is my Father's world:
O let me ne'er forget
That though the wrong seems oft so strong,
God is the Ruler yet.
This is my Father's world:
Why should my heart be sad?
The Lord is King: let the heavens ring!
God reigns; let earth be glad!

15 WHEN I SURVEY

When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died
My richest gain I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
Save in the death of Christ my God
All the vain things that charm me most
I sacrifice them to His blood
See from His head, His hands, His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown
Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all
Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all

16 PASS THE PROMISE

VERSE 1
I will pray rejoicing from my heart
Pray rejoicing from my heart
For in Him my victory's lifted high
His salvation is my cry
He has overcome my enemies
Our praises scorn the enemy
I delight in His deliverance
The Lord is our deliverance
CHORUS
Pass the promise
To our sons and daughters
God most high, God our Father
We bear witness
VERSE 2
There is no one holy like the Lord
Holy, holy is the Lord
Our Rock and refuge is our God
All the earth belongs to God
Do not speak with pride of noble deeds
The Lord will weigh our every deed
See the strong have lost, the weak have gained
And from the dust my life He raised
CHORUS
Pass the promise
To our sons and daughters
God most high, God our Father
We bear witness
VERSE 3
He will guard the feet of faithful ones
He will hold His faithful ones
But the wicked they will not prevail
Not by might will man prevail
He is coming soon to judge the earth
He is coming soon to judge the earth
For the Lord gives power to His King
All Strength to His Anointed King
CHORUS
Pass the promise
To our sons and daughters
God most high, God our Father
We bear witness
CHORUS
Pass the promise
To our sons and daughters
God most high, God our Father
We bear witness
CHORUS
Pass the promise
To our sons and daughters
God most high, God our Father
We bear witness
CHORUS
Pass the promise
To our sons and daughters
God most high, God our Father

17 AMAZING GRACE

Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch; like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

The Lord hath promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.

When we've been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun.

18 COME THOU ALMIGHTY KING

Come, thou Almighty King,
Help us thy name to sing,
Help us to praise!
Father all glorious,
O'er all victorious!
Come and reign over us,
Ancient of days!
Come, thou incarnate word,
Gird on thy mighty sword -
Our pray'r attend!
Come! and thy people bless,
And give thy word success,
Spirit of holiness
On us descend!
All Glory be to the Father
All Glory be to the Son
All Glory be to the Spirit
The Blessed three in one
Come holy Comforter,
Thy sacred witness bear,
In this glad hour!
Thou who Almighty art,
Now rule in ev'ry heart,
And ne'er from us depart.
Spirit of pow'r.
All Glory be to the Father
All Glory be to the Son
All Glory be to the Spirit
The Blessed three in one
To the great one in three
Eternal praises be
Hence - evermore!
Thy sov'reign majesty
May we in glory see
And to eternity
Love and adore!
All Glory be to the Father
All Glory be to the Son
All Glory be to the Spirit
The Blessed three in one.
All Glory be to the Father
All Glory be to the Son
All Glory be to the Spirit
The Blessed three in one.

19 AND ARE YOU SLEEPING

And are you sleeping still my love?
The sun is on the rise
A gentle west wind lifts the leaves,
And songbirds fill the skies.

I closed my eyes in sorrow love,
My heart as cold as stone,
And thought, as darkness covered me,
That I would lie alone.

But you were not alone my love,
Your weariness was mine,
I brought a light into the dark
That you might see it shine.

I closed my eyes in weariness,
I closed my eyes in pain,
And never thought I should be called
To open them again.

I too endured the deadly cold
That chilled us to the bone,
That I might warm the sepulchre
And roll away the stone.

Awaken now to life my love,
Arise alive and free,
Shake off the sleep of death my love,
And come away with me.

And she has risen from her bed
And held her arms out wide
And touched his wounded hands and heart
And gone to be his bride.

20 HOW CAN I KEEP FROM SINGING?

My life flows on in endless song
Above earth's lamentation
I hear the sweet, though far-off hymn
That hails a new creation
Through all the tumult and the strife
I hear that music ringing
It finds an echo in my soul
How can I keep from singing?

While though my joys and comforts die
I know my Savior liveth
While though the darkness gather round
Songs in the night He giveth
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that refuge, clinging
Since Christ is Lord of heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing?

I lift my eyes, the cloud grows thin
I see the blue above it
And, day by day, this pathway smooths
Since, first, I learned to love it
The peace of Christ makes fresh, my heart
A fountain ever springing
All things are mine, since I am His
How can I keep from singing?

The peace of Christ makes fresh, my heart
A fountain ever springing
All things are mine, since I am His
How can I keep from singing?

Till all the earth

22 IT IS WELL

When peace like a river attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,
"It is well, it is well with my soul."

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control:
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
And has shed his own blood for my soul.
It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul.

My sin oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
My sin, not in part, but the whole,
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!
It is well (it is well) with my soul (with my soul)
It is well, it is well with my soul

And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend;
Even so, it is well with my soul.
It is well (bine e) with my soul (in Isus)
It is well, it is well with my soul

Bine e (it is well) in Isus (with my soul)
It is well, it is well with my soul

23 BRIGHTEST AND BEST

Hail blessed morn, see the great Mediator
Down from the regions of glory descend
Shepherds go worship the babe in a manger
Lo! For a guard the bright angels attend
Say, shall we yield Him, in costly devotion
Fragrance of Edom and off'rings divine?
Gems of the mountain and pearls of the ocean
Myrrh from the forest, or gold from the mine?
Brightest and best of sons of the morning
Dawn on our darkness and lend us Thine aid
Star in the East, the horizon adorning
Guide where our infant Redeemer was laid
Vainly we offer each ample oblation
Vainly with gifts would His favor secure
Richer by far is the heart's adoration
Dearer to God are the prayers of the poor
Brightest and best of sons of the morning
Dawn on our darkness and lend us Thine aid
Star in the East, the horizon adorning
Guide where our infant Redeemer was laid
Cold on His cradle the dewdrops were shining
Low lies His bed with the beasts of the stall
Angels adore Him, in slumbers reclining
Wise men and shepherds before Him do fall
Wise men and shepherds before Him do fall
Brightest and best of sons of the morning
Dawn on our darkness and lend us Thine aid
Star in the East, the horizon adorning
Guide where our infant Redeemer was laid
Brightest and best of sons of the morning
Dawn on our darkness and lend us Thine aid
Star in the East, the horizon adorning
Guide where our infant Redeemer was laid
Guide where our infant Redeemer was laid

24 BE THOU MY VISION

Be Thou my vision, O Lord of my heart
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light

Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord
Thou my great Father, and I Thy true son
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one

Be Thou my battle shield, sword for the fight
Be Thou my armor, and be Thou my might
Thou my soul's shelter, Thou my high tower
Raise Thou me heavenward, O power of my power

Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance, now and always
Thou and Thou only first in my heart
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art

High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art
High King of heaven, my victory won
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's sun
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all

25 IMMIGRANT'S SONG

I was a stranger
On the outside looking in
Beyond all favor
I was wandering

She was a mother
But no one to call her own
This lowly stranger
Could never disown
I said
Let me come with you we don't have to be alone
I said
Let me come with you I will make your home my home

CHORUS
Home
I am moving on
Hope
When all hope seemed gone=
Where you are is where I belong
Our home so far from home

There at the edges
Just a little grace to glean
He turned His head then
I found everything
He said
come with me you don't have to be alone
He said
come with me I will build for us a home

CHORUS

I will rest in you beloved
Hide beneath the shadow of your wings

He's our Redeemer
I laid down at His feet
He spread a cover of mercy over me
A moment of changing
I was not what I would be

Bound to Him
Then I am truly free
He said
come with me you don't have to be alone
He said
come with me I will build for us a home

CHORUS

In our home so far from home
Home

26 KEEP LETTING THE LIGHT IN

Stars danced
When you were born
The moon smiled in the sky
Then with that first sun rise
The light poured in your eyes
So little did you know
How quickly you would grow

Long days
Oh, how they rush by
You were bubbling over in my arms
Now you're dancing unaware
By the mirror without a care
So little did you know
How quickly you would grow

CHORUS
I'm here
Whispering in your ear
Oh, keep letting the light in
Keep letting the light in
Keep letting the light in

Night falls
You're scared in the dark
Time has wakened a maze in your mind
Do you wrestle with the shadows?
Do you cover all the windows?
So little did I know
How quickly you would grow

CHORUS

Like waves on the ocean another year fades
Some burdens are lifted, some burdens remain
Sun rises and sets on all that is made
Where tables are full or now missing a face
He who said let there be light
Will surely overcome the night
As another day begins
Keep letting the light in
He's here, He's here
He's here, He's here
He's here
Whispering in your ear
Oh, keep letting the light in
Keep letting the light in
Keep letting the light in

27 IS HE WORTHY?

Do you feel the world is broken? We do
Do you feel the shadows deepen? We do
But do you know that all the dark won't stop the light from getting through? We do
Do you wish that you could see it all made new? We do
Is all creation groaning? It is
Is a new creation coming? It is
Is the glory of the Lord to be the light within our midst? It is
Is it good that we remind ourselves of this? It is

CHORUS
Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He is David's Root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory?
Is He worthy of this? He is

Does the Father truly love us? He does
Does the Spirit move among us? He does
And does Jesus our Messiah hold forever those He loves? He does
Does our God intend to dwell again with us? He does

CHORUS
Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He is David's Root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave
From ev'ry people and tribe
Ev'ry nation and tongue
He has made us a kingdom and priests to God to reign with the Son
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory?
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Is He worthy of this? He is
Is He worthy? Is He worthy? He is
He is

28 CHRIST OUR HOPE IN LIFE AND DEATH (EVENSONG EDITION)

What is our hope in life and death?
Christ alone, Christ alone.
What is our only confidence?
That our souls to him belong.
Who holds our days within his hand?
What comes, apart from his command?
And what will keep us to the end?
The love of Christ, in which we stand.

O sing hallelujah!
Our hope springs eternal;
O sing hallelujah!
Now and ever we confess
Christ our hope in life and death.

What truth can calm the troubled soul?
God is good, God is good.
Where is his grace and goodness known?
In our great Redeemer's blood.
Who holds our faith when fears arise?
Who stands above the stormy trial?
Who sends the waves that bring us nigh

Unto the shore, the rock of Christ?
Unto the grave, what shall we sing?
"Christ, he lives; Christ, he lives!"
And what reward will heaven bring?
Everlasting life with him.
There we will rise to meet the Lord,
Then sin and death will be destroyed,
And we will feast in endless joy,
When Christ is ours forevermore.

29 MY HEART IS FILLED WITH THANKFULNESS

My heart is filled with thankfulness
To Him who bore my pain;
Who plumbed the depths of my disgrace
And gave me life again;
Who crushed my curse of sinfulness
And clothed me in His light
And wrote His law of righteousness
With pow'r upon my heart.

My heart is filled with thankfulness
To Him who walks beside;
Who floods my weaknesses with strength
And causes fears to fly;
Whose ev'ry promise is enough
For ev'ry step I take,
Sustaining me with arms of love
And crowning me with grace.

My heart is filled with thankfulness
To Him who reigns above,
Whose wisdom is my perfect peace,
Whose ev'ry thought is love.
For ev'ry day I have on earth
Is given by the King;
So I will give my life, my all,
To love and follow Him.

31 JESUS, FRIEND OF LITTLE CHILDREN

Jesus, friend of little children
Be a friend to me
Take my hand, and ever keep me
Close to Thee

Teach me how to grow in goodness
Daily as I grow
Thou hast been a child, and surely
Thou must know

Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
The Bible tells me so

Never leave me, nor forsake me
Ever be my friend
For I need Thee from life's dawning
To its end
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
Yes, Jesus loves me
The Bible tells me so

For the Bible tells me so
Little ones to Him belong
They are weak
But He is strong

32 ABIDE WITH ME

Abide with me, fast falls the eventide
The darkness deepens Lord, with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me

Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away
Change and decay in all around I see
O Thou who changest not, abide with me

I need Thy presence every passing hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r?
Who, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me

Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee
In life, in death, o Lord, abide with me
Abide with me, abide with me

33 EVENSONG

Now, as I lay me down to sleep
I pray Thee, Lord, my soul to keep
Oh guard me in Thy tender care
Thy presence calm my every fear
Now, as I lay me down to rest
My wrongful heart I do confess
Oh Savior, cleanse me from my sin
Bring peace with Thee and peace with men
Now, as my children gently sleep
May love and beauty fill their dreams
I pray they seek Thy prefect rest
And on Thy promise lay their heads
Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen
By Thy grace to rise again
Now, turn our hearts toward Thy way
Help those in doubt, in loss, in pain
Oh Lord, have mercy on this world
Thy song of hope be ever heard
Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen
By Thy grace to rise again
By Thy grace to rise again

34 BE STILL MY SOUL / HE WILL HOLD ME FAST

Be still, my soul! the Lord is on thy side
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain
Leave to thy God to order and provide
In ev'ry change be faithful will remain
Be still, my soul! thy best, thy heavenly friend
Through thorny way leads to a joyful end

When I fear my faith will fail
Christ will hold me fast
When the tempter would prevail
He will hold me fast
I could never keep my hold
Through life's fearful path
For my love is often cold
He must hold me fast

He will hold me fast
He will hold me fast
For my Savior loves me so
He will hold me fast

Those He saves are His delight
Christ will hold me fast
Precious in His holy sight
He will hold me fast

He'll not let my soul be lost
His promises shall last
Bought by Him at such a cost
He will hold me fast

For my life He bled and died
Christ will hold me fast
Justice has been satisfied
He will hold me fast
Raised with Him to endless life
He will hold me fast
Till our faith is turned to sight
When He comes at last

35 HUSH-A-BY (COME UNTO ME AND REST)

I heard the voice of Jesus say
"Come unto Me and rest
Lay down, oh weary one, lay down
Thy head upon My breast"

I came to Jesus as I was
So weary, worn and sad
I found in Him a resting place
And He has made me glad

Hush-a-by baby
Oh, ever so dear
Hush-a-by baby
I'll carry you near
Hush-a-by baby
God sees all our tears

And keeps our bottles of tears
Hush-a-by baby
These cries in the night
Never are lost
In the mist of time
Hush-a-by baby

All things will be right
He'll wipe away all our tears
Hush-a-by baby
As winter winds blow
Hush-a-by baby
Lean in from the cold

Hush-a-by baby
There's warmth for your soul
A blanket for your soul
Hush-a-by baby
These whispers will soothe
Your heart like a deer
That darts through the wood
Hush-a-by baby
There's One who is good
The Oak of Peace for your heart
The Oak of Peace for your heart

(Ooo-o-o) hush-a-by, hush-aby
(O-o-o) hush-a-by
(Ooo-o-o) hush-a-by, hush-aby
(O-o-o) hush-a-by

Hush-a-by baby
There's no need to fret
Hush-a-by baby
Though dawn is not yet
Hush-a-by baby
The child on her chest
A mother cannot forget

Hush-a-by baby
So much we can't see
May fear flee away
That we both may sleep
Hush-a-by baby
The Lord surely keeps
Mother and child in His arms
He keeps us both in His arms

36 HIS EYE IS ON THE SPARROW

Why should I feel discouraged
Why should the shadows come
Why should my heart feel lonely
And long for heaven and home

When Jesus is my portion
A constant friend is He
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches over me

I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me

37 LILY IN THE VALLEY

Lily in the valley
Sparrows in skies above
The sun now slowly setting
Held in the Father's love
Oh child do not be troubled
You are worth more than these
His face has shone upon you
He is the pearl you seek
And worry adds no single hour
But He knows every need
Lis dans la vallee
Les moineaux dans les airs
Le soleil part lentement
Tenu dans l'amour du Pere
Enfant ne sois pas trouble
Tu vaux plus que ceux-ci
Son visage brille sur toi
Il est la perle que tu cherches
T'inquieter n'ajoute pas une heure
Il connait tous tes besoins
He is the pearl you seek
And worry adds no single hour
But He knows every need

38 THE LORD IS IN HIS HOLY TEMPLE

The Lord is in His holy temple
Let all the earth keep silence
Verse 1
Where were you when the earth was made
And the morning stars sang out together
When the seas burst forth from the womb
And you wrapped the clouds in darkness
Have you ever showed the dawn it's place
Or walked the recess of the deep
Oh, the mysteries He holds are His to keep
Verse 2
Who can tip the heavens' water jars
Or set up on the earth the Lord's dominion
Do you give the horse its flowing mane
Or does the hawk fly by your wisdom
Who gives breath to fill a babies cry
Who stirs the soul to look for light
Without His eternal word, there is no life
Bridge 1
Keep silence, silence, silence before Him
Bridge 2
The Lord is in His holy temple, let the earth keep silence
Verse 3
Who can say in their heart there is no God
Whose arm is strong enough against Him
He who dwells beyond all time and space
And will judge with perfect justice
For I speak too soon what I don't know
These things too wonderful to grasp
It is He who is the first and is the last
The Lord is in His holy temple
Let all the earth keep silence

39 SUN OF MY SOUL

Sun of my soul, open my eyes

As morning fills the skies

You are the light guiding my ways

Through the shadows

Shine, shine

Shine, shine

Lighten the darkness oh sun of my soul

Shine, shine

Shine, shine

Sun of my soul, steady my gaze

As daylight runs its race

Your Word is a lamp unto my feet

On this journey

You're shining down on me

As nightfall calls the stars

You are my light, promise of peace

While I'm sleeping

Shine, shine

Shine, shine

Lighten the darkness oh sun of my soul

Shine, shine

Shine, shine

Lighten the darkness oh sun of my soul

40 CONSIDER THE STARS (CINEMATIC EDITION)

Holds you in his hands

43 CHRIST THE TRUE AND BETTER

Christ the true and better Adam
Son of God and Son of man
Who, when tempted in the garden
Never yielded, never sinned
He who makes the many righteous
Brings us back to life again
Dying, He reversed the curse, then
Rising, crushed the serpent's head

Christ the true and better Isaac
Humble son of sacrifice
Who would climb the fearful mountain
There to offer up his life
Laid with faith upon the altar
Father's joy and only son
There salvation was provided
Oh what full and boundless love

CHORUS
Amen, amen
From beginning to end
Christ the story
His the glory
Alleluia, amen

Christ the true and better Moses
Called to lead a people home
Standing bold to earthly powers
God's great glory to be known
With his arms stretched wide to heaven
See the waters part in two
See the veil is torn forever
Cleansed with blood we pass now through

CHORUS

Christ the true and better David
Lowly shepherd, mighty King
He the champion in the battle
Where, o death, is now thy sting?
In our place He bled and conquered
Crown Him Lord of majesty
His shall be the throne forever
We shall e'er His people be

CHORUS x2

44 ON JORDAN'S STORMY BANKS

On Jordan's Stormy Banks

On Jordan's stormy banks I stand

And cast a wishful eye

To Canaan's fair and happy land

Where my possessions lie

All o'er those wide extended plains

Shines one eternal day

There God the Son forever reigns

And scatters night away

CHORUS

I am bound (I am bound)

I am bound (I am bound)

I am bound for the promised land

I am bound (I am bound)

I am bound (I am bound)

I am bound for the promised land

No chilling winds nor poisonous breath

Can reach that healthful shore

Sickness, sorrow, pain and death

Are felt and feared no more

CHORUS

When shall I reach that happy place

And be forever blessed?

When shall I see my Father's face

And in His bosom rest?

CHORUS

45 TAKE SHELTER

When the nations rage

And death is at the door

When the wars are waged

As they have been before

There's a refuge that I run to

A respite from my fear

Nothing in this world can harm me here

When my song of hope

Is swallowed by the pain

As the weariness of grief

Floods in again

Will you find me in the valley?

Oh, hear my helpless cry

Hold me as a mother holds her child

And I'll take shelter

Take shelter

In the loving arms of God

And I will take shelter

Take shelter

In the loving arms of God

When a greater war had torn apart my soul

And the iron hold of sin would not let go

All of heaven stormed the darkness

In the power of the cross

I'm freed beneath the banner of His love

And I'll take shelter

Take shelter

In the loving arms of God

And I will take shelter

Take shelter

In the loving arms of God

When the labors of this fleeting life are done

As the shadows fall, we'll see the lights of home

And then all our prayers and troubles will be stories of the past

Safe within His gates, we'll find our rest

And I'll take shelter

Take shelter

In the loving arms of God

And I will take shelter

Take shelter

In the loving arms of God

(Take shelter)

I'll take shelter

In the loving arms of God

And I will take shelter

Take shelter

In the loving arms of God

46 THE LORD ALMIGHTY REIGNS

There's an endless song

Waiting to be sung

With the voice of every tribe

The sound of every tongue

When the bride of Christ

On that day of days

Brings with joy unto the Lamb

A multitude of praise

Like the roar of mighty seas

And rolls of thunder

Hear His people sing

Hallelujah, hallelujah

For the Lord Almighty reigns

Hallelujah, hallelujah

For the Lord, our God, the Almighty reigns

We will join the feast

Rest from battles won

Tell with great rejoicing

All the wonders God has done

And like the roar of mighty seas

And rolls of thunder

All the church will sing

Hallelujah, hallelujah

For the Lord Almighty reigns

Hallelujah, hallelujah

For the Lord, our God, the Almighty reigns

Certain of that day

Christ we will proclaim

Oh, that more would share the prize

Salvation in His name

Then greater will the anthem ring

A mighty chorus rising to the King

Hallelujah, hallelujah

For the Lord Almighty reigns

Hallelujah, hallelujah

For the Lord, our God, the Almighty reigns

Hallelujah, hallelujah

For the Lord Almighty reigns

Hallelujah, hallelujah

For the Lord, our God, the Almighty reigns

48 BEAUTIFUL AND GREATLY LOVED

Your Irish eyes are shining

Dizzy thoughts run through your head

As the day is closing

And I look at you the way you look

At fireflies that dance upon the dusk

You are beautiful and greatly loved

You are beautiful and greatly loved

Though the flower may fade

Your worth will never age

While the chicks are growing

And draws them out towards the edge

To find their wings for flying

So I long to see you rise

And find His grace will always be enough

You are beautiful and greatly loved

You are beautiful and greatly loved

Though the flower may fade

Your worth will never age

The breath of heaven from above

Flows through the both of us

A gentle quiet spirit

A beauty that delights the Lord

And those of old retell it

My aging hands will rest on yours

I'll tell you ever keep your heart up

You are beautiful and greatly loved

You are beautiful and greatly loved

Though the flower may fade

Your worth will never age

The breath of heaven from above

Flows through the both of us

Singing over us

You are greatly loved

You are greatly loved

50 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE LORD

If it had not been for the Lord on our side

When strong raging floods surrounded us

We'd be surely crushed beneath the waves of sin

If it had not been for

If it had not been for the Lord

If it had not been for the Lord on our side

When dry desert plains had wearied us

But for grace we'd still be wandering in those lands

If it had not been for

If it had not been for the Lord

Our hope our help from age to age the same

Our God our rock most worthy to be praised

From this mount of grace our grateful hearts will say

Evermore... if it had not been for the Lord

If it had not been for the Lamb on that cross

Where love full and free reached down to us

There would be no peace with God, no peace with man

If it had not been for

If it had not been for the Lord

Our hope our help from age to age the same

Our God our rock most worthy to be praised

From this mount of grace our grateful hearts will say evermore

If it had not been for the Lord

If it had not been for the Lord on that day

Before heaven's throne what would we say

There with endless wonder we will shout Amen

If it had not been for

If it had not been for the Lord

51 LORD FROM SORROWS DEEP I CALL (PSALM 42)

Lord, from sorrows deep I call
When my hope is shaken
Torn and ruined from the fall
Hear my desperation
For so long I've pled and prayed
God, come to my rescue
Even so the thorn remains
Still my heart will praise You

Storms within my troubled soul
Questions without answers
On my faith these billows roll
God, be now my shelter
Why are you cast down my soul?
Hope in Him who saves you
When the fires have all grown cold
Cause this heart to praise You
Should my life be torn from me
Every worldly pleasure
When all I possess is grief
God, be then my treasure
Be my vision in the night
Be my hope and refuge
Till my faith is turned to sight
Lord, my heart will praise You

And, oh, my soul, put your hope in God
My help, my Rock, I will praise Him
Sing, oh, sing through the raging storm
You're still my God, my salvation

52 COME BEHOLD THE WONDROUS MYSTERY

Come behold the wondrous mystery
In the dawning of the King
He the theme of heaven's praises
Robed in frail humanity
In our longing, in our darkness
Now the Light of Life has come
Look to Christ, Who condescended
Took on flesh to ransom us

Come behold the wondrous mystery
He the perfect Son of Man
In His living, in His suffering
Never trace nor stain of sin
See the true and better Adam
Come to save the hell-bound man
Christ the great and sure fulfillment
Of the law; in Him we stand

Come behold the wondrous mystery
Christ the Lord upon the tree
In the stead of ruined sinners
Hangs the Lamb in victory
See the price of our redemption
See the Father's plan unfold
Bringing many sons to glory
Grace unmeasured, love untold

Come behold the wondrous mystery
Slain by death the God of life
But no grave could e'er restrain Him
Praise the Lord; He is alive!
What a foretaste of deliverance
How unwavering our hope
Christ in power resurrected
As we will be when He comes

53 MAGNIFICENT, MARVELOUS, MATCHLESS LOVE

Magnificent, marvelous, matchless love; too vast and astounding to tell
Forever existing in worlds above, now offered and given to all.
Oh, fountain of beauty eternal; the Father, the Spirit, the Son.
Sufficient and endlessly generous, magnificent, marvelous, matchless love.
Creation is brimming with thankfulness, the mountains, exultant they stand;
The seasons rejoice in Your faithfulness, all life is sustained by Your hand.
You crown every meadow with color; You paint every shade in the sky;
Each day the dawn wakes as an encore of magnificent, marvelous, matchless love.
Chorus
How great, how sure; His love endures forevermore.
Magnificent, marvelous, matchless love.
What grace, that You entered our brokenness; You came in the fullness of time
How far we had fallen from righteousness, but not from the mercies of Christ.
Your cross is our door to redemption; Your death is our fullness of life.
That day, how forgiveness flowed as a flood: magnificent, marvelous, matchless love.
How great, how sure; His love endures forevermore.
Magnificent, marvelous, matchless love.
United in Your resurrection, You lift us to infinite heights
Could anything sever or take us from magnificent, marvelous, matchless love
How great, how sure; His love endures forevermore.
Magnificent, marvelous, matchless love.

54 HIS MERCY IS MORE

What love could remember no wrongs we have done;
Omniscient, all-knowing, He counts not their sum.
Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore;
Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more.

Chorus
Praise the Lord!
His mercy is more.
Stronger than darkness; new every morn;
Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more.

What patience would wait as we constantly roam;
What Father, so tender, is calling us home.
He welcomes, the weakest, the vilest, the poor;
Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more.

What riches of kindness He lavished on us;
His blood was the payment, His life was the cost.
We stood 'neath a debt we could never afford;
Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more.

55 SING WE THE SONG OF EMMANUEL

Sing we the song of Emmanuel
This the Christ who was long foretold
Lo in the shadows of Bethlehem
Promise of dawn now our eyes behold.
God Most High in a manger laid
Lift your voices and now proclaim
Great and glorious, Love has come to us
Join now with the hosts of heaven
Come we to welcome Emmanuel
King who came with no crown or throne
Helpless He lay, the Invincible
Maker of Mary, now Mary's son
O what wisdom to save us all
Shepherds, sages, before Him fall
Grace and majesty, what humility
Come on bended knee, adore Him
Go spread the news of Emmanuel
Joy and peace for the weary heart
Lift up your heads, for your King has come
Sing for the Light overwhelms the dark
Glory shining for all to see
Hope alive, let the gospel ring
God has made a way, He will have the praise
Tell the world His name is Jesus
Gloria, Gloria!

56 CHRIST THE SURE AND STEADY ANCHOR

Christ the sure and steady anchor
In the fury of the storm
When the winds of doubt blow through me
When my sails have all been torn

In the suffering, in the sorrow
When my sinking hopes are few
I will hold fast to the anchor
It will never be removed

Christ the sure and steady anchor
While the tempest rages on
When temptation claims the battle
And it seems the night has won

Deeper still then goes the anchor
Though I justly stand accused
I will hold fast to the anchor
It shall never be removed

Christ the sure and steady anchor
Through the floods of unbelief
Hopeless somehow, o my soul
Now, lift your eyes to Calvary

This my ballast of assurance
See His love forever proved
I will hold fast to the anchor
It will never be removed

Christ the sure and steady anchor
As we face the wave of death
When these trials give way to glory
As we draw our final breath

We will cross that great horizon
Clouds behind and life secure
And the calm will be the better
For the storms that we endure

Christ the shore of our salvation
Ever faithful ever true

57 THE KING IN ALL HIS BEAUTY

Vs 1
O lift your eyes to Heaven see
The Holy One eternal
Behold the Lord of Majesty
Exalted in His temple
As symphonies of angels' praise
Now strain to sound His glory
Come worship, fall before His grace
The King in all His beauty
Chorus
How worthy, how worthy
How worthy
The King in all His beauty
Vs 2
Now see the King who wears a crown
One made of shame and splinters
The sacrifice for ruined man
The substitute for sinners
As Earth is stained with royal blood
And quakes with love and fury
He breathes His last and bows His head
The King in all His beauty
Vs 3
Now see the Savior lifted up
The Lamb who reigns in splendor
The hope of every tribe and tongue
His kingdom is forever
Bring praise and honor to His courts
Bring wisdom, power, blessing
For endless ages we'll adore
The King in all His beauty

58 MY SAVIOR'S LOVE (WHAT TONGUE COULD TELL)

Vs 1
What tongue could tell my Savior's love
What song of angels could describe
Could endless praises be enough
To echo full His sacrifice
How worthy is the Lamb of God
Beyond all might or skill of pen
Still we confess and strain towards
Such mystery and magnificence
Chorus
My Savior's love
My Savior's love
What could compare
What tongue could tell my Savior's love
Vs 2
What tune could carry on its wings
The beauty of that final breath
What words dare paint the awesome scene
When God stood in the stead of man
When Jesus Christ the radiant One
Took on the shadows of our hate
Then rose again just as the sun
With light and power in fullest grace
Vs
And when in death this tongue is stilled
My song of life has reached the end
Though as a flower I may wilt
This everlasting truth will stand
No death or life could separate
Me from the love of Christ my Lord
This hope is sure from age to age

59 LORD HAVE MERCY (FOR WHAT WE HAVE DONE)

For what we have done and left undone
We fall on Your countless mercies
For sins that are known and those unknown
We call on Your name so holy
For envy and pride, for closing our eyes
For scorning our very neighbor
In thought word and deed we've failed You our King
How deeply we need a Savior

Chorus
Lord have mercy Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us
Lord have mercy Christ have mercy
Lord have mercy on us

Verse 2
For what You have done Your life of love
You perfectly lived we praise You
Though tempted and tried You fixed Your eyes
You finished the work God gave You
And there on the tree A King among thieves
You bled for a world's betrayal
You loved to the end Our merciful friend
How pure and forever faithful

Bridge
For hearts that are cold for seizing control
For scorning our very Maker
In thought word and deed we've failed You our King
How deeply we need a Savior

60 HOW RICH A TREASURE WE POSSESS

How rich a treasure we possess
In Jesus Christ our Lord
His blood our ransom and defense
His glory our reward
The sum of all created things
Is worthless in compare
For our inheritance is Him
Whose praise angels declare

How free and costly was the love
Displayed upon the cross
While we were dead in untold sin
The Sovereign purchased us
The will of God the Father
Demonstrated through the Son
The Spirit seals the greatest work
The work which Christ has done

CHORUS
For Yours is the Kingdom and the power
And the glory
Yours is the Kingdom and the power
And the glory Amen

How vast and measureless the flood
Of mercy unrestrained
The penalty was paid in full
The spotless Lamb was slain
Salvation what a priceless gift
Received by grace through faith
We stand in robes of righteousness
We stand in Jesus' Name

61 CHRIST IS ALL

Vs 1
I've found a treasure that can't be taken
Found a well that won't run dry
O worldly pleasure be now forsaken
Behold what love what life is mine
Vs 2
Could endless striving now make me righteous
Could all my works now grant me hope
Oh hallelujah the blood of Jesus
My only plea my only boast
Chorus
Christ is all Christ is all
And my song will ever be
Christ is all, All in all
And my song will ever be
Christ is all
Vs 3
And in the trial when storms are raging
Though tears may fall my soul will rise
For there's a peace that is mine un - changing
There is a joy that never dies
Vs 4
When life is passing and strength is fading
I'll see the One that I adore
Let this world vanish oh give me Jesus
My great desire my true reward

62 COME ADORE THE HUMBLE KING

Come adore the humble King
Lowly in the manger
Fall before His majesty
Hail the little Savior
Hope what hope no tongue could tell
God has come with us to dwell
His name is Emmanuel
O praise the humble King

Come adore in humble state
He the song of angels
Join the wise who call His name
And with all creation
Who oh who would condescend
God unknown now calls us friend
Love that none could comprehend
O praise the humble King

Come adore the King who came
To our world to save us
Born to heal our prideful race
Crown us with forgiveness
Fall oh fall before the one
Who in mercy left His throne
Christ the Lord God's only Son
His glories now we sing
O praise the humble King

Come adore come adore
Come adore the King
Bow before come adore the
Name above all names

63 I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVES

I know that my Redeemer lives
What hope this sweet assurance gives
That he who gave his life for me
Arose with healing in his wings
He lives, the tomb is empty still
Redemption's promise he fulfilled
No condemnation now remains
The stone of death is rolled away

CHORUS
My redeemer lives
My redeemer lives
On heaven's throne, and in my very soul
I know that my Redeemer lives

I know that my Redeemer lives
And all my life is bound to his
In realms above, he intercedes
Our sinless Savior, perfect priest
No fear can follow where he guides
His constant presence is my light
No power on earth or heav'n above
Can separate us from his love

REPEAT CHORUS

I know that my redeemer lives
In life and death I trust in him
My soul secure, my future safe
He'll not forsake me to the grave
He lives and He will not delay
My eyes will wake to brightest day
And in my flesh I'll see him stand
When Christ in glory comes again
And every eye will see him stand
When Christ in glory comes again

REPEAT CHORUS

On heaven's throne, and in my very soul
I know that my Redeemer lives.

64 THE LORD ALMIGHTY REIGNS (FEATURING SHANE & SHANE)

There's an endless song
Waiting to be sung
With the voice of every tribe
The sound of every tongue
When the bride of Christ
On that day of days
Brings with joy unto the Lamb
A multitude of praise
Like the roar of mighty seas
And rolls of thunder
Hear His people sing
Hallelujah, hallelujah
For the Lord Almighty reigns
Hallelujah, hallelujah
For the Lord, our God, the Almighty reigns
We will join the feast
Rest from battles won
Tell with great rejoicing
All the wonders God has done
And like the roar of mighty seas
And rolls of thunder
All the church will sing
Hallelujah, hallelujah
For the Lord Almighty reigns
Hallelujah, hallelujah
For the Lord, our God, the Almighty reigns
Certain of that day
Christ we will proclaim
Oh, that more would share the prize
Salvation in His name
Then greater will the anthem ring
A mighty chorus rising to the King
Hallelujah, hallelujah
For the Lord Almighty reigns
Hallelujah, hallelujah
For the Lord, our God, the Almighty reigns
Hallelujah, hallelujah
For the Lord Almighty reigns
Hallelujah, hallelujah
For the Lord, our God, the Almighty reigns

65 I AM NOT MY OWN

The One who made the heavens made my heart and soul
Before I drew a breath, I was loved and known
I am His creation, the Maker's masterpiece
And all that He designs will be done in me

My body is a temple of the Living God
I'll worship in this house that His blood has bought
As I bear His image, oh may I not profane
The holiness I hold in this earthly frame

CHORUS
I belong to the Lord, oh I am not my own
I belong to the Lord, I am not my own
I will honor Him for this I know
I belong to the Lord, I am not my own

And if He has redeemed me, I am not my own
The measure of my worth is His love alone
He declares my standing, and He declares my state
So I will know myself by the name He gave

REPEAT CHORUS

I am not my own and now my heart is free
O Maker come and make what You will of me
There is nothing broken that You cannot repair
So Lord, I leave my life in Your loving care

REPEAT CHORUS

I will honor Him for this I know
I belong to the Lord, I am not my own

66 THERE IS A HIGHER THRONE

There is a higher throne
Than all this world has known,
Where faithful ones from ev'ry tongue
Will one day come.
Before the Son we'll stand,
Made faultless through the Lamb;
Believing hearts find promised grace--
Salvation comes.
REFRAIN
Hear heaven's voices sing;
Their thund'rous anthem rings
Through em'rald courts and sapphire skies.
Their praises rise.
All glory, wisdom, pow'r,
Strength, thanks, and honor are
To God our King, who reigns on high
Forevermore.
And there we'll find our home,
Our life before the throne;
We'll honor Him in perfect song
Where we belong.
He'll wipe each tear-stained eye
As thirst and hunger die.
The Lamb becomes our Shepherd King;
We'll reign with Him.

67 HABLA OH DIOS (SPEAK O LORD)

Habla, oh Dios, y yo escuchare
Quiero recibir Tu Palabra fiel.
Tu Verdad, plantala en mi ser
Y moldeame a Tu imagen;

Que Tu voz, oh Dios, de Su fruto en mi
Produciendo amor y el obrar por fe

Habla, oh Dios, y haz Tu obra en mi,
Para Tu honor y Tu gloria.

Habla, oh Dios, y ensename
A obedecer con toda humildad.
Pruebame y escudriname
Bajo el resplandor de Tu santidad.
Haz crecer mi fe, haz que pueda ver
Tu glorioso amor y Tu autoridad.
Que Tu voz, voz de gran poder,
Quite de mi ser la incredulidad.

Habla, oh Dios, y renuevame
Para comprender Tus propositos.
Tu verdad nunca cambiara,
Permanecera por la eternidad
Junto a Ti, por fe, yo caminare
Tus promesas son mi unico sosten.

Habla, oh Dios, edificanos,
Llena el mundo hoy de Tu gloria.

68 SPEAK, O LORD

Speak, O Lord, as we come to You
To receive the food of Your Holy Word.
Take Your truth, plant it deep in us;
Shape and fashion us in Your likeness,
That the light of Christ might be seen today
In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.
Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us
All Your purposes for Your glory.
Teach us, Lord, full obedience,
Holy reverence, true humility;
Test our thoughts and our attitudes
In the radiance of Your purity.
Cause our faith to rise; cause our eyes to see
Your majestic love and authority.
Words of pow'r that can never fail--
Let their truth prevail over unbelief.
Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds;
Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us--
Truths unchanged from the dawn of time
That will echo down through eternity.
And by grace we'll stand on Your promises,
And by faith we'll walk as You walk with us.
Speak, O Lord, till Your church is built
And the earth is filled with Your glory.

69 ACROSS THE LANDS

You're the Word of God the Father
From before the world began.
Ev'ry star and ev'ry planet
Has been fashioned by Your hand.
All creation holds together
By the power of Your voice.
Let the skies declare Your glory;
Let the land and seas rejoice!

CHORUS
You're the Author of creation;
You're the Lord of ev'ry man;
And Your cry of love rings out across the lands.
Yet You left the gaze of angels,
Came to seek and save the lost,
And exchanged the joy of heaven
For the anguish of a cross.
With a prayer You fed the hungry;
With a word You calmed the sea;
Yet how silently You suffered
That the guilty may go free!
With a shout You rose victorious,
Wresting vict'ry from the grave,
And ascended into heaven,
Leading captives in Your way.
Now You stand before the Father,
Interceding for Your own;
From each tribe and tongue and nation,
You are leading sinners home!

70 EVERY PROMISE OF YOUR WORD

From the breaking of the dawn to the setting of the sun,
I will stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.
Words of power, strong to save, that will never pass away,
I will stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.
For Your covenant is sure,
And on this I am secure--
I can stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.
When I stumble and I sin, condemnation pressing in,
I will stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.
You are faithful to forgive that in freedom I might live,
So I stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.
Guilt to innocence restored,
You remember sins no more--
So I'll stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.
When I'm faced with anguished choice, I will listen for Your voice,
And I'll stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.
Through this dark and troubled land
You will guide me with Your hand
As I stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.
And You've promised to complete
Ev'ry work begun in me--
So I'll stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.
Hope that lifts me from despair, love that casts out ev'ry fear,
As I stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.
Not forsaken, not alone, for the Comforter has come,
And I stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.
Grace sufficient, grace for me,
Grace for all who will believe--
We will stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.

71 MY WORTH IS NOT IN WHAT I OWN

My worth is not in what I own
Not in the strength of flesh and bone
But in the costly wounds of love
At the cross
My worth is not in skill or name
In win or lose, in pride or shame
But in the blood of Christ that flowed
At the cross
Refrain:
I rejoice in my Redeemer
Greatest Treasure,
Wellspring of my soul
I will trust in Him, no other.
My soul is satisfied in Him alone.
As summer flowers we fade and die
Fame, youth and beauty hurry by
But life eternal calls to us
At the cross
I will not boast in wealth or might
Or human wisdom's fleeting light
But I will boast in knowing Christ
At the cross
Refrain
Two wonders here that I confess
My worth and my unworthiness
My value fixed - my ransom paid
At the cross
Refrain

72 GRACE

Your grace that leads the sinner home
From death to life forever
And sings the song of righteousness
By blood and not by merit

Your grace that reaches far and wide
To every tribe and nation
Has called my heart to enter in
The joy of Your salvation

CHORUS
By grace I am redeemed
By grace I am restored
And now I freely walk into
The arms of Christ my Lord

Your grace that I cannot explain
Not by my earthly wisdom
The Prince of Life without a stain
Was traded for this sinner

Let praise rise up and overflow
My song resound forever
For grace will see me welcomed home
To walk beside my savior

73 LOVINGKINDNESS

Let praises now awake the dawn
We'll greet Your mercy with a song
Your people stand and sing for all
Your lovingkindness
You've carried us in faithfulness
Upon the paths of righteousness
Our gracious King You've crowned us with
Your lovingkindness
CHORUS
How great is Your lovingkindness
O God of goodness
Our joy forever to sing the glad refrain
Of grace that saved us
Of sweet forgiveness
O how great is
Your lovingkindness
You lift us with a Father's hand
You shelter us with Your commands
What heart could fully comprehend
Your mercies endless
You lead us through the shadows deep
Where doubts trace every step, it seems
But as the darkness breaks we'll see
The morning promise
CHORUS
A life laid down to rescue us
With arms outstretched upon the cross
The greatest Gift there ever was
Of lovingkindness
A life laid down to rescue us
With arms outstretched upon the cross
The greatest Gift there ever was
Of lovingkindness
Your lovingkindness
CHORUS x2

74 PSALM 121 (I LIFT MY EYES)

I lift my eyes up to the Hills
From where does my help come?
My help comes from the Maker of
The heavens and the earth
He will not let my foot be moved
He keeps my journey safe
CHORUS
O my soul, praise the Lord most high
Strong to save, He upholds my life
Forevermore, He will be my light
I lift my eyes up to the Lord most high
He is the shade at my right hand
My shelter in the storm
No sun by day, nor moon by night
Shall ever bring me harm
He will not slumber, will not sleep
He watches all my ways
CHORUS
I lift my eyes up to the hills
From where does my help come
My help comes from the Maker of
The heavens and the earth
The God of Isr'l is my guide
Wherever I may go
And in His strength I will abide
Until He leads me home
CHORUS x2

75 PSALM 150 (PRAISE THE LORD)

You made the starry hosts
You traced the mountain peaks
You paint the evening sky with wonders
The earth, it is Your throne
From desert to the sea
All nature testifies Your splendor

CHORUS
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Sing His greatness
All creation
Praise the Lord
Raise your voice
You heights and all you depths
From furthest east to west
Let everything that has breath
Praise the Lord

You reached into the dust
In love, Your Spirit breathed
You formed us in Your very likeness
To know Your wondrous works
To tell Your mighty deeds
To join the everlasting chorus

CHORUS
Let symphonies resound
Let drums and choirs ring out
All heaven hear the sound of worship
Let every nation bring
Its honors to the King
A roar of harmonies eternal

FINAL CHORUS
Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Sing His greatness
All creation
Praise the Lord
Raise your voice
You heights and all you depths
From furthest east to west
You distant burning stars
All creatures near and far
From sky to sea to shore
Sing out forevermore
Let everything that has breath
Praise the Lord

76 THE EVERLASTING LOVE OF GOD

How vast the everlasting love of God,
How sure and faithful as the morning.
This love so great for us could never fail
Nor end, for it had no beginning
CHORUS
O, the everlasting love of God,
It shall ever be my song
So immense and free; more than life to me!
The everlasting love of God
How strong the Father's beating heart for us,
What mercy runs to meet the sinner.
As rivers yearn to reach the lowest place,
His grace shall flow to me for ever.
CHORUS
How great and precious my Redeemer's blood,
How pure the passion of the Savior.
My sins are drowned beneath this mighty flood,
My soul is swept away with wonder
CHORUS
How deep the measure of the Spirit's work
Who dwells in us, Who seals the promise
God's love through time and all eternity
Shall stand and we shall stand upon it
What now could separate us from it
O, the everlasting love of God,
It shall ever be my song
So immense and free; more than life to me!
The everlasting love of God
The everlasting love of God.

78 WE WILL FEAST IN THE HOUSE OF ZION (FEATURING HB CHARLES)

We will feast in the house of Zion
We will sing with our hearts restored
He has done great things, we will say together
We will feast and weep no more
We will not be burned by the fire
He is the LORD our God
We are not consumed, by the flood
Upheld, protected, gathered up
In the dark of night, before the dawn
My soul, be not afraid
For the promised morning, oh how long?
Oh God of Jacob, be my strength
Every vow we've broken and betrayed
You are the Faithful one
And from the garden to the grave
Bind us together, bring shalom

79 A MIGHTY FORTRESS IS OUR GOD

A mighty fortress is our God,
a bulwark never failing;
Our helper He amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing.

For still our ancient foe
doth seek to work us woe;
his craft and power are great,
and armed with cruel hate,
on earth is not his equal.

Did we in our own strength confide,
our striving would be losing,
were not the Right Man on our side,
the Man of God's own choosing.

Dost ask who That may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He;
Lord Sabaoth, His name,
from age to age the same,
and He must win the battle.

And though this world, with devils filled,
should threaten to undo us,
we will not fear, for God hath willed
His truth to triumph through us.

The Prince of Darkness grim,
we tremble not for him;
his rage we can endure,
for lo, his doom is sure;
one little word shall fell him.

That Word above all earthly powers,
no thanks to them, abideth;
the Spirit and the gifts are ours,
thru Him who with us sideth.

Let goods and kindred go,
this mortal life also;
the body they may kill;
God's truth abideth still;
His kingdom is forever.

80 GREAT IS THY FAITHFULNESS / MY REDEEMER IS FAITHFUL AND TRUE

"Great is Thy faithfulness," O God my Father,
There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not
As Thou hast been Thou forever wilt be.

"Great is Thy faithfulness!" 
"Great is Thy faithfulness!"
Morning by morning new mercies I see;
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
"Great is Thy faithfulness,"
"Great is Thy faithfulness,"
"Great is Thy faithfulness," Lord, unto me!

81 COME THOU LONG EXPECTED JESUS

Come, Thou long-expected Jesus
Born to set Thy people free
From our fears and sins release us
Let us find our rest in Thee
Israel's strength and consolation
Hope of all the earth Thou art
Dear desire of every nation
Joy of every longing heart
Born Thy people to deliver
Born a child and yet a King
Born to reign in us forever
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring
By Thine own eternal spirit
Rule in all our hearts alone
By Thine own sufficient merit
Raise us to Thy glorious throne

82 HARK! THE HERALD ANGELS SING

Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King:
peace on earth, and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!"
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
join the triumph of the skies;
with th'angelic hosts proclaim,
"Christ is born in Bethlehem!"

Refrain
Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King"

Christ, by highest heaven adored,
Christ, the everlasting Lord,
late in time behold him come,
offspring of the Virgin's womb:
veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
hail th'incarnate Deity,
pleased with us in flesh to dwell,
Jesus, our Immanuel. 

Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Sun of Righteousness!
Light and life to all he brings,
risen with healing in his wings.
Mild he lays his glory by,
born that we no more may die,
born to raise us from the earth,
born to give us second birth.

83 ANGELS WE HAVE HEARD ON HIGH / JOY HAS DAWNED

Joy has dawned upon the world,
Promised from creation--
God's salvation now unfurled,
Hope for ev'ry nation.

Not with fanfares from above,
Not with scenes of glory,
But a humble gift of love--
Jesus born of Mary.

Sounds of wonder fill the sky
With the songs of angels
As the mighty Prince of Life
Shelters in a stable.

Hands that set each star in place,
Shaped the earth in darkness,
Cling now to a mother's breast,
Vuln'rable and helpless.

Shepherds bow before the Lamb,
Gazing at the glory;
Gifts of men from distant lands
Prophesy the story.

Gold--a King is born today,
Incense--God is with us,
Myrrh--His death will make a way,
And by His blood He'll win us.

Son of Adam, Son of heaven,
Given as a ransom;
Reconciling God and man,
Christ, our mighty champion!

What a Savior! What a Friend!
What a glorious myst'ry!
Once a babe in Bethlehem,
Now the Lord of hist'ry.

84 IN THE BLEAK MIDWINTER

In the bleak midwinter frosty wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow
In the bleak midwinter long ago
Our God, heav'n cannot hold Him nor earth sustain
Heav'n and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
For the Lord, God Almighty, Jesus Christ
Gloria, Gloria! Now my eyes have seen
Soli Deo Gloria! He salvation brings
As the Lord has promised, I may go in peace
What can I give Him poor as I am
If I were a shepherd I would bring a lamb
If I were a Wise Man I would do my part
Yet what can I give him? Give my heart
Gloria, Gloria! Now my eyes have seen
Soli Deo Gloria! He salvation brings
In the bleak midwinter I may go in peace

85 JESUS JOY OF THE HIGHEST HEAVEN (WITH JESUS JOY OF MAN'S DESIRING)

Jesus, joy of the highest heaven,
Born as a little baby
Under a wondrous star.

Like us, crying he takes His first breath
Held by His mother, helpless
Close to her beating heart.

Jesus, laid in a lowly manger,
Facing a world of dangers,
Come to turn me a stranger
Into a child of God.

Jesus, King of the highest heaven
Learning to take His first steps,
That He might bring us life.

Like us, knowing our smiles and sorrows,
He showed the way to follow,
A way that is true and right.

Jesus, take away every darkness,
Steady my simple footsteps
That I might in your goodness
Live as a child of God.

86 JOY TO THE WORLD

Joy to the World, the Lord has come!
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing.

Joy to the World, the Savior reigns!
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy.

No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as, the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, wonders, of His love

88 O LITTLE TOWN OF BETHLEHEM

O little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight
For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth
How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven
No ear may hear His coming
Bu in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him still
The dear Christ enters in
O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born in us today
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell
O come to us, abide with us
Our Lord Emmanuel

89 ONCE IN ROYAL DAVID'S CITY

Once in royal David's city,
Stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her baby
In a manger for His bed:
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ her little child.
And through all His wondrous childhood,
He would honor and obey,
Love and watch the lowly maiden,
In whose gentle arms He lay.
Christian children all should be,
Mild, obedient, good as He.
For He is our childhood's pattern,
Day by day like us He grew,
He was little, weak, and helpless,
Tears and smiles like us He knew,
And He feeleth for our sadness,
And He shareth in our gladness.
Not in that poor lowly stable,
With the oxen standing by,
We shall see Him, but in heaven,
Set at God's right hand on high;
When like stars His children crowned,
All in white shall be around

90 SILENT NIGHT

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon virgin, Mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
Song of God, Love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord at Thy birth

91 O GIVE THANKS

The bountiful, fount of all provision

O give thanks to God forever
For all he's done for all he's given
For every grace, bring every praise
To the giver of all, give thanks
O give thanks unto Jesus
Sing of his saving love
The Bread of Life, broken for redemption
How he carried the cross t
o
make us daughters and sons
Exalted now, the King of our salvation
O give thanks to the Spirit
Fire of joy, bond of love
O Breath of God, help our hearts remember
Purge our pride with your kindness
Plant this song deep in us
For all the gifts, greater is the Giver

Alive He stands, their friend and king

Christ is risen, He is risen indeed

Where doubt and darkness once had been
They saw Him and their hearts believed
But blessed are those who have not seen

They preached the truth and power of grace
And pouring out their lives they gained
Life, life everlasting

Christ is risen, He is risen indeed!
Oh, sing hallelujah
Join the chorist' and all the redeemed

Now works in us to powerfully save
He frees our hearts to live His grace

The offspring of David, the ancient of days

Heir of heaven, humble servant, He rides to the
cross

lost
'Till death has been conquered, live won for the
Lost

107 ACROSS THE LANDS

You're the Word of God the Father
From before the world began.
Ev'ry star and ev'ry planet
Has been fashioned by Your hand.
All creation holds together
By the power of Your voice.
Let the skies declare Your glory;
Let the land and seas rejoice!

CHORUS
You're the Author of creation;
You're the Lord of ev'ry man;
And Your cry of love rings out across the lands.

Yet You left the gaze of angels,
Came to seek and save the lost,
And exchanged the joy of heaven
For the anguish of a cross.
With a prayer You fed the hungry;
With a word You calmed the sea;
Yet how silently You suffered
That the guilty may go free!

With a shout You rose victorious,
Wresting vict'ry from the grave,
And ascended into heaven,
Leading captives in Your way.
Now You stand before the Father,
Interceding for Your own;
From each tribe and tongue and nation,
You are leading sinners home!

108 WE BELIEVE (APOSTLE'S CREED)

Chorus:
We believe in one true God
Father, Spirit, Son
One Church, one faith, one Lord of all

We believe in God the Father
Almighty, Lord of life
Creator of the Heavens
The earth, the sea, the sky
And we believe in Jesus
The only son of God
Born of the virgin Mary
Who lived as one of us
CHORUS
We believe that Jesus suffered
Was beaten, crucified
He died and he was buried
Entombed in darkest night
The third day rose victorious
Ascended into Heav'n
Will one day come to judge us
The living and the dead
CHORUS
We believe in God the Spirit
One church, empowered by Him
Communion of God's people
Forgiveness of our sin;
Our bodies resurrected
To everlasting life
To worship, love and wonder
Before the throne of Christ
CHORUS

109 COMPASSION HYMN

There is an everlasting kindness
You lavished on us
When the Radiance of heaven Came to rescue the lost;
You called the sheep without a shepherd
To leave their distress
For your streams of forgiveness
And the shade of Your rest.
And with compassion for the hurting,
You reached out Your hand
As the lame ran to meet You
And the dead breathed again;
You saw behind the eyes of sorrow
And shared in our tears,
Heard the sigh of the weary,
Let the children draw near.
CHORUS
What boundless love,
What fathomless grace
You have shown us, O God of compassion!
Each day we live
An offering of praise
As we show to the world Your compassion.
We stood beneath the cross of Calvary
And gazed on Your face
At the thorns of oppression
And the wounds of disgrace,
For surely You have borne our suffering
And carried our grief
As You pardoned the scoffer
And showed grace to the thief.
How beautiful the feet that carry
This gospel of peace
To the fields of injustice
And the valleys of need--
To be a voice of hope and healing,
To answer the cries
Of the hungry and helpless
With the mercy of Christ.

110 BY FAITH

By faith we see the hand of God
In the light of creation's grand design
In the lives of those who prove His faithfulness
Who walk by faith and not by sight
By faith our fathers roamed the earth
With the power of His promise in their hearts
Of a holy city built by God's own hand
A place where peace and justice reign
We will stand as children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward
Till the race is finished and the work is done
We'll walk by faith and not by sight
By faith the prophets saw a day
When the longed-for Messiah would appear
With the power to break the chains of sin and death
And rise triumphant from the grave
By faith the church was called to go
In the power of the Spirit to the lost
To deliver captives and to preach good news
In every corner of the earth
We will stand as children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward
Till the race is finished and the work is done
We'll walk by faith and not by sight
By faith this mountain shall be moved
And the power of the gospel shall prevail
For we know in Christ all things are possible
For all who call upon His name
We will stand as children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward
Till the race is finished and the work is done
We'll walk by faith and not by sight

111 FACING A TASK UNFINISHED

Facing a task unfinished
That drives us to our knees
A need that, undiminished
Rebukes our slothful ease
We, who rejoice to know Thee
Renew before Thy throne
The solemn pledge we owe Thee
To go and make Thee known

Where other lords beside Thee
Hold their unhindered sway
Where forces that defied Thee
Defy Thee still today
With none to heed their crying
For life, and love, and light
Unnumbered souls are dying
And pass into the night

We go to all the world
With kingdom hope unfurled
No other name has power to save
But Jesus Christ The Lord

We bear the torch that flaming
Fell from the hands of those
Who gave their lives proclaiming
That Jesus died and rose
Ours is the same commission
The same glad message ours
Fired by the same ambition
To Thee we yield our powers

We go to all the world
With kingdom hope unfurled
No other name has power to save
But Jesus Christ The Lord

O Father who sustained them
O Spirit who inspired
Saviour, whose love constrained them
To toil with zeal untired
From cowardice defend us
From lethargy awake!
Forth on Thine errands send us
To labour for Thy sake

We go to all the world
With kingdom hope unfurled
No other name has power to save
But Jesus Christ The Lord

We go to all the world
His kingdom hope unfurled
No other name has power to save
But Jesus Christ The Lord

112 FOR THE CAUSE

For the cause of Christ the King
We give our lives, an offering
'Til all the earth resounds
With ceaseless praise
To the Son
For the cause of Christ we go
With joy to reap, with faith to sow
As many see
And many put their trust in the Son
CHORUS
Christ we proclaim,
The Name above every name:
For all creation,
Ev'ry nation,
God's salvation
Through the Son!
For the King once lifted high
To cries of rage, of 'crucify!'
Endured the cross
As every sin was laid
On the Son
To the King who conquered death
To free the poor and the oppressed
For lasting peace
For life and liberty
In the Son
CHORUS
Let it be my life's refrain:
To live is Christ, to die is gain;
Deny myself, take up my cross
And follow the Son
CHORUS

113 MAY THE PEOPLES PRAISE YOU

You have called us out of darkest night
Into Your glorious light
That we may sing the wonders of
The risen Christ
May our every breath retell the grace
That broke into our strife
With boundless love and deepest joy
With endless life
Chorus:
May the peoples praise You
Let the nations be glad
All Your blessing comes
That we may praise
May praise the Name of Jesus
All the earth is Yours and all within
Each harvest is Your own
And from Your hand we give to You
To make Christ known
May the seeds of mercy grow in us
For those who have not heard
May songs of praise build lives of grace
To spread Your Word
CHORUS
This our holy privilege to declare
Your praises and Your name
To every nation, tribe and tongue,
Your church proclaims
CHORUS
Holy, holy is the Lord Almighty
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb Who was slain
Holy, holy is the Lord Almighty
All creation praise Your glorious Name
CHORUS

114 NOTHING BUT THE BLOOD / JESUS SHALL REIGN

What can wash away my sins
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me whole again
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
For my cleansing this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
For my pardon this my plea
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Nothing can my sin erase
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Tis not of works, tis all of grace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

115 OH HOW GOOD IT IS

Oh how good it is
When the family of God
Dwells together in spirit
In faith and unity.
Where the bonds of peace,
Of acceptance and love
Are the fruit of His presence
Here among us.
CHORUS
So with one voice we'll sing to the Lord
And with one heart we'll live out His word
Till the whole earth sees
The Redeemer has come
For He dwells in the presence of His people.
Oh how good it is
On this journey we share
To rejoice with the happy
And weep with those who mourn.
For the weak find strength
The afflicted find grace
When we offer the blessing
Of belonging.
CHORUS
Oh how good it is
To embrace His command
To prefer one another
Forgive as He forgives.
When we live as one
We all share in the love
Of the Son with the Father
And the Spirit.

Jesus, my Redeemer,
name above all names,

Lamb for sinners slain.

When I stand in glory
I will see his face
and there I'll serve my King for ever
in that holy place.

Awake, my soul, and sing
of him who died for thee,
and hail him as thy matchless king
through all eternity.

Crown him the Son of God
Before the worlds began,
And ye, who tread where He hath trod,
Crown him the Son of Man;
Who every grief hath known
That wrings the human breast,
And takes and bears them for His own,
That all in him may rest.

Crown him the Lord of life,
who triumphed o'er the grave,
and rose victorious in the strife
for those he came to save;
his glories now we sing
who died and rose on high,
who died eternal life to bring,
and lives that death may die.

Crown him the Lord of heaven,
Enthroned in worlds above;
Crown him the king, to whom is given
The wondrous name of Love,
Crown him with many crowns,
As thrones before him fall.
Crown him, ye kings, with many crowns,
For He is King of all.

119 ALL CREATURES OF OUR GOD AND KING

All creatures of our God and King,

Thou rushing wind that art so strong,
Ye clouds that sail in heav'n along,

120 O FOR A THOUSAND TONGUES TO SING

O for a thousand tongues to sing
my great Redeemer's praise,
the glories of my God and King,
the triumphs of his grace!

My gracious Master and my God,
assist me to proclaim,
to spread thro' all the earth abroad
the honors of Thy name.

Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb,
your loosened tongues employ;
ye blind, behold your savior come,
and leap, ye lame, for joy.

He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
he sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean;
His blood availed for me.

In Christ, your head, you then shall know,
shall feel your sins forgiven;
anticipate your heaven below,
and own that love is heaven.

He speaks, and listening to his voice,
new life the dead receive;
the mournful, broken hearts rejoice,
the humble poor believe.

Glory to God all glory, and praise, and love
be now and ever given
by saints below and saints above,
the Church in earth and heaven.

121 JESUS PAID IT ALL

I hear the Savior say,
Thy strength indeed is small,
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all.

Refrain
Jesus paid it all,
All to Him I owe;
Sin had left a crimson stain,
He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow'r and Thine alone,
Can change the leper's spots
And melt this heart of stone. 

Refrain

For nothing good have I
Where-by Thy grace to claim;
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb. 

Refrain

And when, before the throne,
I stand in Him complete,
"Jesus died my soul to save,"
My lips shall still repeat. 

Refrain

122 POWER IN THE BLOOD

Would you be free from your burden of sin
There's power in the blood power in the blood
Would you o'er evil a victory win
There's wonderful power in the blood

There is power power wonder working power in the blood of the lamb
There is power power wonder working power in the precious blood of lamb

Would you be whiter much wither than snow
There's power in the blood power in the blood
Sin's stains are lost and it's life giving flow
There's one flicker power in the blood

There is power power wonder working power in the blood of the lamb
There is power power wonder working power in the precious blood of lamb

Would you do service for Jesus your king
There's power in the blood power in the blood
Would you lift David his praises to sing
There's wonderful power in the blood

There is power power wonder working power in the blood of the lamb
There is power power wonder working power in the precious blood of lamb

123 HE WILL HOLD ME FAST

When I fear my faith will fail
Christ will hold me fast
When the tempter would prevail
He will hold me fast
I could never keep my hold
Through life's fearful path
For my love is often cold
He must hold me fast

CHORUS
He will hold me fast
He will hold me fast
For my Savior loves me so
He will hold me fast

Those He saves are His delight
Christ will hold me fast
Precious in His holy sight
He will hold me fast
He'll not let my soul be lost
His promises shall last
Bought by Him at such a cost
He will hold me fast

CHORUS

For my life He bled and died
Christ will hold me fast
Justice has been satisfied
He will hold me fast
Raised with Him to endless life
He will hold me fast
Till our faith is turned to sight
When he comes at last

CHORUS

124 ALL THINGS BRIGHT & BEAUTIFUL

All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,
All things wise and wonderful,.
'twas God that made them all.
Each little flower that opens,
Each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing color,
He made their tiny wings.
All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,

All things wise and wonderful,.
'twas God that made them all.
The purple headed mountains,
The river running by,
The sunset and the morning
That brightens up the sky.
All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,

All things wise and wonderful,.
'twas God that made them all.
He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips hat we might tell,
How great is the Almighty,
Who has made all things well.
All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,
All things wise and wonderful,.
'twas God that made them all.
The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,
He made them every one.

125 AND CAN IT BE

And can it be that I should gain
An int'rest in the Savior's blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, should die for me?

Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, should die for me!

'Tis mystery all! Th'Immortal dies!
Who can explore His strange design?
In vain the firstborn seraph tries
To sound the depths of love divine!
'Tis mercy all! let earth adore,
Let angel minds inquire no more. 

He left His Father's throne above,
So free, so infinite His grace;
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam's helpless race;
'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me.

126 REVIVE US AGAIN / BLESSED ASSURANCE

We praise Thee, O God!
For the Son of Thy love,
For Jesus Who died,
And is now gone above.
Hallelujah! Thine the glory.
Hallelujah! Amen.
Hallelujah! Thine the glory.
Revive us again.
We praise Thee, O God!
For Thy Spirit of light,
Who hath shown us our Savior,
And scattered our night.
All glory and praise
To the Lamb that was slain,
Who hath borne all our sins,
And hath cleansed every stain.
All glory and praise
To the God of all grace,
Who hast brought us,
and sought us,
And guided our ways.
Revive us again;
Fill each heart with Thy love;
May each soul be rekindled
With fire from above.

127 IT IS WELL

When peace like a river attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,
"It is well, it is well with my soul."
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control:
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
And has shed his own blood for my soul.

It is well with my soul;
it is well, it is well with my soul.
My sin oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
My sin, not in part, but the whole,
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

It is well (it is well) with my soul (with my soul)
It is well, it is well with my soul
And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend;
Even so, it is well with my soul.
It is well (bine e) with my soul (in Isus)
It is well, it is well with my soul

Bine e (it is well) in Isus (with my soul)
It is well, it is well with my soul

128 FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE EARTH

For the beauty of the earth,
For the glory of the skies,
For the love which from our birth
Over and around us lies:
Christ, our God, to Thee we raise
this, our sacrifice of praise.
For the beauty of each hour
Of the day and of the night,
Hill and vale, and tree and flow'r,
Sun and moon, and stars of light:
Christ, our God, to Thee we raise
this, our sacrifice of praise.
For the joy of human love,
Brother, sister, parent, child,
Friends on earth, and friends above;
For all gentle thoughts and mild:
Christ, our God, to Thee we raise
this, our sacrifice of praise.
For each perfect Gift of Thine
To our race so freely given,
Graces human and Divine,
Flowers of earth, and buds of Heaven:
Christ, our God, to Thee we raise
This our Sacrifice of Praise.

129 CHRIST THE LORD IS RISEN TODAY

Christ the Lord is risen today, Alleluia!
Earth and heaven in chorus say, Alleluia!
Raise your joys and triumphs high, Alleluia!
Sing, ye heavens, and earth reply, Alleluia!

Love's redeeming work is done, Alleluia!
Fought the fight, the battle won, Alleluia!
Death in vain forbids him rise, Alleluia!

Lives again our glorious King, Alleluia!

Once he died our souls to save, Alleluia!
Where's thy victory, boasting grave? Alleluia!

Following our exalted Head, Alleluia!
Made like him, like him we rise, Alleluia!
Ours the cross, the grave, the skies, Alleluia!

130 HOW SHALL I SING?

How shall I sing that majesty
That angels do admire?
Their thunderous voices bid me come
Sing, sing oh heavenly choir!

CHORUS
Thousands and thousands stand before Your throne
O God Most High
Sing all you saints and all created things
To praise the Lord of life
Let planets spin in sheer delight
While galaxies conspire
To fill the universe with light
Sing, sing oh heavenly choir!

CHORUS

The saints who lived and died in grace
Have found their hearts' desire
To gaze upon the Savior's face
Sing, sing oh heavenly choir!

CHORUS

So let my voice resound with those
Whose praise will never die
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost
Sing, sing oh heavenly choir!

131 HALLELUJAH! WHAT A SAVIOR

Man of sorrows, what a name
For the Son of God, who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim
Hallelujah, what a Savior!

Bearing shame and scoffing rude
In my place condemned He stood
Sealed my pardon with His blood
Hallelujah, what a Savior!

Guilty, vile and helpless, we
Spotless Lamb of God was He
Full redemption--can it be?
Hallelujah, what a Savior!

Lifted up was He to die
"It is finished" was His cry
Now in heav'n exalted high
Hallelujah, what a Savior!

When He comes, our glorious King
To His Kingdom us to bring
Then anew this song we'll sing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, what a Savior!

132 BLESSINGS

We pray for blessings, we pray for peace
Comfort for family, protection while we sleep
We pray for healing, for prosperity
We pray for Your mighty hand to ease our suffering
And all the while, You hear each spoken need
Yet love us way too much to give us lesser things
What if Your blessings come through rain drops
What if Your healing comes through tears
What if a thousand sleepless nights are what
it takes to know You're near
What if trials of this life are Your mercies in disguise
We pray for wisdom, Your voice to hear
We cry in anger when we cannot feel You near
We doubt Your goodness, and we doubt Your love
As if every promise from Your word is not enough
And all the while, You hear each desperate plea
And long that we'd have faith to believe
CHORUS
When friends betray us
When darkness seems to win
We know that pain reminds this heart
That this is not,
This is not our home
It's not our home
What if Your blessings come through rain drops
What if Your healing comes through tears
What if a thousand sleepless nights are what
it takes to know You're near
What if my greatest disappointments
or the achings of this life
Is the revealing of a greater thirst this world can't satisfy
What if trials of this life
The rain, the storms, the hardest nights
Are Your mercies in disguise

133 ALL I HAVE IS CHRIST

I once was lost in darkest night
Yet thought I knew the way
The sin that promised joy and life
Had led me to the grave
I had no hope that You would own
A rebel to Your will
And if You had not loved me first
I would refuse You still

But as I ran my hell-bound race
Indifferent to the cost
You looked upon my helpless state
And led me to the cross
And I beheld God's love displayed
You suffered in my place
You bore the wrath reserved for me
Now all I know is grace

Hallelujah! All I have is Christ
Hallelujah! Jesus is my life
Now, Lord, I would be Yours alone
And live so all might see
The strength to follow Your commands
Could never come from me
Oh Father, use my ransomed life
In any way You choose
And let my song forever be
My only boast is You

134 GOD THE UNCREATED ONE (KING FOREVERMORE)

God the Uncreated One
The author of salvation
Who wrote the laws of space and time
And fashioned worlds to His design
The one whom angel hosts revere
Hung the stars like chandeliers
Numbered every grain of sand
Knows the heart of every man
He is King forever
He is King forever
He is King forevermore
God our fortress and our strength
The rock on which we can depend
Matchless in His majesty
His power and authority
Unshaken by the schemes of man
Never-changing, Great I Am
Kingdoms rise and kingdoms fall
He is faithful through it all
Crown Him King forever
Crown Him King forever
Crown Him King forevermore
Mighty God in mortal flesh
Forsaken by a traitor's kiss
The curse of sin and centuries
Did pierce the lowly Prince of Peace
Lift ed high, the sinless man
Crucifi ed, the spotless Lamb
Buried by the sons of man
Rescued by the Father's hand
To reign as King forever
Reign as King forever
Reign as King forevermore
King Eternal, God of Grace
We crown You with the highest praise
Heaven shouts and saints adore
You're Holy, Holy, Holy Lord!
What joy in everlasting life
All is love and faith is sight
Justi ce rolls and praises rise
At the name of Jesus Christ
King of Kings forever
King of Kings forever
King of Kings forevermore

135 WHAT SACRED FOUNTAIN

What sacred fountain freely springs up
From the throne of God
And all new covenant blessing brings?
It's Jesus' precious blood
What mighty sum paid all my debt
When I a bankrupt stood
And has my life in credit set?
It's Jesus' precious blood
CHORUS:
O precious blood, it covers me
It takes away the stain of sin
Such power there is contained within
Jesus' precious blood
What stream is that, which sweeps away
My sin just like a flood
So not a hint of it can stay?
It's Jesus' precious blood
What voice is that which speaks for me
In heaven's high court for good
And justifies and sets me free?
It's Jesus' precious blood
CHORUS
What theme my soul shall best employ
Your song before Your God
And make all heaven ring for joy?
It's Jesus' precious blood

136 JESUS SHALL REIGN

Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
Does its successive journeys run
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore
Till sun shall rise and set no more

Blessings abound where'er He reigns
The pris'ner leaps to lose his chains
The weary find eternal rest
And all the sons of want are blessed

CHORUS:
To our King be highest praise
Rising through eternal days
Just and faithful He shall reign:
Jesus shall reign!

People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest song
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on His name

CHORUS
Let every creature rise and bring
Blessing and honor to our King
Angels descend with songs again
And earth repeat the loud amen!

CHORUS

137 ONLY A HOLY GOD (WITH HOLY, HOLY, HOLY)

139 LOVE STILL BIDS YOU WELCOME

Oh God of grace, how often have I grieved Thee
How seldom have I sung Thy praise
And little do I know how much I need Thee
And time again I turn away
For how my heart is hard and unbelieving
For all I've done and left undone
Your love is not reluctant to receive me
My soul draws back but love says, "Come"
He will not cast you out
He will not cast you out
Whoever enters in
Will forever dwell with Him
Draw near, faint heart, draw near
Oh, Love still bids you welcome here
Oh Father, when I sin against my neighbor
I turn away your very Son
Who died to call us friends when we were strangers
And says to ev'ry sinner, "Come"
He will not cast you out
He will not cast you out
Whoever enters in
Will forever dwell with Him
Draw near, faint heart, draw near
Oh, Love still bids you welcome here
Oh Lord of light, You call us out of darkness
To turn aside from sin and live
And prodigals, we come to you for pardon
Oh, Abba, Father take us in
He will not cast you out
He will not cast you out
Whoever enters in
Will forever dwell with Him
He will not cast you out
He will not cast you out
Whoever enters in
Will forever dwell with Him
Draw near, faint heart, draw near
Oh, Love still bids you welcome here
Draw near, faint heart, draw near
Oh, Love still bids you welcome here
He will not cast you out
He will not cast you out
Whoever enters in
Will forever dwell with Him
He will not cast you out
He will not cast you out
Whoever enters in
Will forever dwell with Him
Draw near, faint heart, draw near
Oh, Love still bids you welcome here

140 BEHOLD OUR GOD

Who has held the oceans in His hands?
Who has numbered every grain of sand?
Kings and nations tremble at His voice
All creation rises to rejoice
Behold our God seated on His throne
Come, let us adore Him
Behold our King! Nothing can compare
Come, let us adore Him!
Who has given counsel to the Lord?
Who can question any of His words?
Who can teach the One Who knows all things?
Who can fathom all His wondrous deeds?
Behold our God seated on His throne
Come, let us adore Him
Behold our King! Nothing can compare
Come, let us adore Him!
Who has felt the nails upon His hands
Bearing all the guilt of sinful man?
God eternal humbled to the grave
Jesus, Savior risen now to reign!
Behold our God seated on His throne
Come, let us adore Him
Behold our King! Nothing can compare
Come, let us adore Him!
Men: You will reign forever
Women: Let Your glory fill the earth
Behold our God seated on His throne
Come, let us adore Him
Behold our King! Nothing can compare
Come, let us adore Him!

141 I STAND AMAZED (HOW MARVELOUS)

I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus, the Nazarene
And wonder how he could love me
Asinner, condemned, unclean

How marvelous, how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Savior's love for me!

He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them his very own
He bore the burden to Calvary
And suffered and died alone

How marvelous, how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Savior's love for me!

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see
Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of his love for me

How marvelous, how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Savior's love for me!

How marvelous, how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous, how wonderful
Is my Savior's love for me!

142 CROSSING THE POND (INSTRUMENTAL MEDLEY INCL TOTAL PRAISE)

Lord, I will lift mine eyes to the hills
Knowing my help is coming from You
Your peace, You give me in time of the storm
You are the source of my strength
You are the strength of my life
I lift my hands in total praise to you
You are the source of my strength
You are the strength of my life
I lift my hands in total praise to you
Amen, Amen (Amen)
Amen, Amen (Amen)

143 SPEAK, O LORD

Speak, O Lord, as we come to You
To receive the food of Your Holy Word.
Take Your truth, plant it deep in us;
Shape and fashion us in Your likeness,

That the light of Christ might be seen today
In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.
Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us
All Your purposes for Your glory.

Teach us, Lord, full obedience,
Holy reverence, true humility;
Test our thoughts and our attitudes
In the radiance of Your purity.

Cause our faith to rise; cause our eyes to see
Your majestic love and authority.
Words of pow'r that can never fail--
Let their truth prevail over unbelief.

Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds;
Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us--
Truths unchanged from the dawn of time
That will echo down through eternity.

And by grace we'll stand on Your promises,
And by faith we'll walk as You walk with us.
Speak, O Lord, till Your church is built
And the earth is filled with Your glory.

144 SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE A MOTHERLESS CHILD

Sometimes I feel like a motherless child,
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child,
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child,
A long way from home, a long way from home.
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost done,
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost done,
Sometimes I feel like I'm almost done,
And a long, long way from home, a long way from home.
True believer,
True believer,
A long, long way from home,
A long, long way from home.

145 BECAUSE HE LIVES

God sent His son, They called Him Jesus
He came to love, Heal and forgive
He bled and died, To buy my pardon
An empty grave Is there to prove
My Savior lives 

Because He lives
I can face tomorrow
Because He lives
All fear is gone
Because I know
He holds the future
And life is worth the living
Just because He lives

How sweet to hold, Our new born baby
And feel the pride And joy He gives
But greater still that calm assurance
We can face uncertain days 
Because He lives

And then one day, I'll cross the river
And fight life's final war with pain
And then As death gives way to victory
I'll see the lights of glory, And I'll know He reigns

Because He lives
I can face tomorrow
Because He lives
All fear is gone
Because I know
He holds the future
And life is worth the living
Just because He lives.

146 IT WAS FINISHED UPON THAT CROSS (W CITYALIGHT)

How I love the voice of Jesus
On the cross of Calvary
He declares His work is finished
He has spoken this hope to me
Though the sun had ceased its shining
Though the war appeared as lost
Christ had triumphed over evil
It was finished upon that cross
Now the curse, it has been broken
Jesus paid the price for me
Full, the pardon He has offered
Great, the welcome that I receive
Boldly, I approach my Father
Clothed in Jesus' righteousness
There is no more guilt to carry
It was finished upon that cross
Death was once my great opponent
Fear once had a hold on me
But the Son who died to save us
Rose that we would be free indeed!
Death was once my great opponent
Fear once had a hold on me
But the Son who died to save us
Rose that we would be free indeed!
Yes, He rose that we would be free indeed!
Free from every plan of darkness
Free to live and free to love
Death is dead and Christ is risen!
It was finished upon that cross
Onward to eternal glory
To my Savior and my God
I rejoice in Jesus' victory
It was finished upon that cross
It was finished upon that cross
It was finished upon that cross

But do you know that all the dark won't stop the light from getting through? We do
Do you wish that you could see it all made new? We do

Is the glory of the Lord to be the light within our midst? It is
Is it good that we remind ourselves of this? It is

Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He is David's Root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory?
Is He worthy of this? He is

Does the Father truly love us? He does
Does the Spirit move among us? He does
And does Jesus our Messiah hold forever those He loves? He does
Does our God intend to dwell again with us? He does

CHORUS
Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He is David's Root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave
From ev'ry people and tribe
Ev'ry nation and tongue
He has made us a kingdom and priests to God to reign with the Son
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Of all blessing and honor and glory?
Is He worthy? Is He worthy?
Is He worthy of this? He is

Is He worthy? Is He worthy? He is
He is

151 THE POWER OF THE CROSS

Oh to see the dawn of the darkest day
Christ on the road to Calvary
Tried by sinful men, torn and beaten then
Nailed to the cross of wood
This the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us, took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross
Oh to see the pain written on your face
Bearing the awesome weight of sin
Every bitter thought every evil deed
Crowning your blood stained brow
This the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us, took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross
Now the day light flees, now the ground beneath
Quakes as its maker bows his head
Curtain torn in two, dead are raised to life
Finished, the victory cry
This the power of the cross
Christ became sin for us, took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross
Oh to see my name written in the woods
For through your suffering I am free
Death is crushed to death, life is mine to live
Won through your selfless love
This the power of the cross
Son of God slain for us, one above, one across
We stand forgiven at the cross

152 HOLY SPIRIT (WITH GABRIEL'S OBOE)

Holy Spirit, living Breath of God,
Breathe new life into my willing soul.
Bring the presence of the risen Lord
To renew my heart and make me whole.
Cause Your Word to come alive in me;
Give me faith for what I cannot see;
Give me passion for Your purity.
Holy Spirit, breathe new life in me.

Holy Spirit, come abide within;
May Your joy be seen in all I do--
Love enough to cover ev'ry sin
In each thought and deed and attitude,
Kindness to the greatest and the least,
Gentleness that sows the path of peace.
Turn my striving into works of grace.
Breath of God, show Christ in all I do.

Holy Spirit, from creation's birth,
Giving life to all that God has made,
Show Your power once again on earth;
Cause Your church to hunger for Your ways.
Let the fragrance of our prayers arise.
Lead us on the road of sacrifice
That in unity the face of Christ
Will be clear for all the world to see.

153 GETHSEMANE

To see the King of heaven fall
In anguish to His knees,
The Light and Hope of all the world
Now overwhelmed with grief.
What nameless horrors must He see,
To cry out in the garden:
Oh, take this cup away from me
Yet not my will but Yours,
Yet not my will but Yours.
To know each friend will fall away,
And heaven's voice be still,
For hell to have its vengeful day
Upon Golgotha's hill.
No words describe the Saviour's plight -
To be by God forsaken
Till wrath and love are satisfied
And every sin is paid
And every sin is paid
What took Him to this wretched place,
What kept Him on this road?
His love for Adam's cursed race,
For every broken soul.
No sin too slight to overlook,
No crime too great to carry,
All mingled in this poisoned cup ,
And yet He drank it all,
The Saviour drank it all,
The Saviour drank it all.

154 SIMPLE LIVING (A RICH YOUNG MAN)

A rich young man came to ask of Christ:
"Good teacher, will you tell me
What must I do for eternal life?
I've kept your laws completely."
"Sell all you have; give to the poor.
Then heaven's treasure shall be yours."
How hard for those who are rich on earth
To gain the wealth of heaven.
Now Jesus sat by the offering gate
As people brought their money.
The rich they filled the collection plate;
The widow gave a penny.
"Now she's out-given all the rest;
Her gift was all that she possessed."
Not what you give but what you keep
Is what the King is counting.
Oh teach me Lord to walk this road,
The road of simple living;
To be content with what I own
And generous in giving.
And when I cling to what I have,
Please wrest it quickly from my grasp.
I'd rather lose all the things of earth
To gain the things of heaven.
Yes, I'd rather lose all the things of earth
To gain the things of heaven.

155 THE PERFECT WISDOM OF OUR GOD

The perfect wisdom of our God,
Revealed in all the universe:
All things created by His hand,
And held together at His command.
He knows the mysteries of the seas,
The secrets of the stars are His;
He guides the planets on their way,
And turns the earth through another day.
The matchless wisdom of His ways,
That mark the path of righteousness;
His word a lamp unto my feet,
His Spirit teaching and guiding me.
And oh, the mystery of the cross,
That God should suffer for the lost
So that the fool might shame the wise,
And all the glory might go to Christ!
Oh grant me wisdom from above,
To pray for peace and cling to love,
And teach me humbly to receive
The sun and rain of Your sovereignty.
Each strand of sorrow has a place
Within this tapestry of grace;
So through the trials I choose to say:
"Your perfect will in your perfect way.

156 KYRIE ELEISON

Kyrie eleison; have mercy.
Christe eleison; have mercy.
Kyrie eleison; have mercy.
Christe eleison; have mercy.
As we come before You
With the needs of our world,
We confess our failures and our sin,
For our words are many
Yet our deeds have been few;
Fan the fire of compassion
Once again.
CHORUS
When the cries of victims
Go unheard in the land,
And the scars of war refuse to heal,
Will we stand for justice
To empower the weak
Til their bonds of oppression
Are no more?
CHORUS
If we love our God with all our
Heart, mind, and strength,
And we love our Neighbors as ourselves,
Then this law of love
Will heal the nations of earth,
And the glory of Christ Will be revealed.
CHORUS
Lord, renew our vision
To be Christ where we live,
To reach out in mercy to the lost;
For each cup of kindness
To the least in our midst
Is an offering of worship
To the throne.

157 CHRIST IS RISEN, HE IS RISEN INDEED

How can it be, the One who died
Has borne our sin through sacrifice
To conquer every sting of death
Sing, sing hallelujah
For joy awakes as dawning light
When Christ's disciples lift their eyes
Alive He stands, their friend and king
Christ, Christ, He is risen
Christ is risen, He is risen indeed!
Oh, sing hallelujah
Join the chorist' and all the redeemed
Christ is risen, He is risen indeed
Where doubt and darkness once had been
They saw Him and their hearts believed
But blessed are those who have not seen
Yet, sing hallelujah
Once bound by fear now bold in faith
They preached the truth and power of grace
And pouring out their lives they gained
Life, life everlasting
Christ is risen, He is risen indeed!
Oh, sing hallelujah
Join the chorist' and all the redeemed
Christ is risen, He is risen indeed
The power that raised Him from the grave
Now works in us to powerfully save
He frees our hearts to live His grace
Go tell of His goodness
Christ is risen, He is risen indeed!
Oh, sing hallelujah
Join the chorist' and all the redeemed
Christ is risen, He is risen indeed
Christ is risen, He is risen indeed!
Oh, sing hallelujah
Join the chorist' and all the redeemed
Christ is risen, He is risen indeed
He is risen, He's alive, He's alive!
Heaven's gates are opened wide
He's alive, He's alive!
Now in heaven glorified
He's alive, He's alive!
Heaven's gates are opened wide
He's alive, He's alive!
Now in heaven glorified

158 A MOTHER'S PRAYER

Before you close your eyes to sleep
I have a promise still to keep
As I hold you in my arms.

I pray your little frame grows strong
And that faith takes hold while you are young;
This is my prayer for you.

Hold my hand;
I'll teach you the Way to go.
Through the joys, through the tears,
The journey of these years,
May you trust Him 'til the end.
May you trust Him in the end.

This world is not as it should be,
But the Savior opens eyes to see
All that's beautiful and true.

Oh may His light fill all you are
And the jewel of wisdom crown your heart;
This is my prayer for you.

Hold my hand;
I'll teach you the Way to go.
Through the joys, through the tears,
The journey of these years,
He is with us 'til the end.
He is faithful 'til the end.

You'll travel where my arms won't reach
As the road will rise to lead your feet
On a journey of your own.

May my mistakes not hinder you
But His grace remain and guide you through;
This is my prayer for you.

Take His hand
And go where He calls you to.
And whatever comes, seek Him
With all your heart;
This will be my prayer for you.
mmmm Father, hear my ceaseless prayer;
Oh keep them in your care.

Dun do shuil (Close Your Eyes)
Dun do shuil, a run mo chroi
(Close your eyes, oh love of my heart)
A chuid den tsaol, 's a ghra liom
(My worldly joy, my treasure)
Dun do shuil, a run mo chroi
(Close your eyes, oh love of my heart)
Agus gheobhair feirin amarach...
(And you will get a gift tomorrow)

159 BEFORE YOU I KNEEL (A WORKER'S PRAYER)

Before You I kneel, my Master and Maker,
To offer the work of my hands.
For this is the day You've given Your servant;
I will rejoice and be glad
For the strength I have to live and breathe,
For each skill Your grace has given me,
For the needs and opportunities
That will glorify Your great name.
Before You I kneel and ask for Your goodness
To cover the work of my hands.
For patience and peace to shape all my labor,
Your grace for thorns in my path.
Flow within me like a living stream,
Wear away the stones of pride and greed
'Til Your ways are dwelling deep in me
And a harvest of life is grown.
Before You we kneel, our Master and Maker;
Establish the work of our hands.
And order our steps to seek first Your kingdom
In every small and great task.
May we live the gospel of Your grace,
Serve Your purpose in our fleeting days,
Then our lives will bring eternal praise
And all glory to Your great name.

160 ECHOES OF HEAVEN (WEDDING SONG)

I turn, I come to you;
Let my heart be still.
As I listen to your voice,
May I take my fill.
For I bring my life to you,
Knowing I'll find:
I'll ever be yours,
As you will be mine.
With the first light of dawn,
I won't hide my face;
I will open my hands
To the hold of your grace.
As the echoies of Heaven
Bind up our hearts,
No shadow that falls
Can tear us apart.
Though the summer grows old
And the autumn draws near,
My soul is a child,
Free from every fear.
For the promise you gave me
Grows richer with time.
I'll ever be yours,
As you will be mine.
I'll ever be yours,
As you will be mine.

161 BENEATH THE CROSS

Beneath the cross of Jesus
I find a place to stand,
And wonder at such mercy
That calls me as I am;
For hands that should discard me
Hold wounds which tell me, "Come."
Beneath the cross of Jesus
My unworthy soul is won.
Beneath the cross of Jesus
His family is my own--
Once strangers chasing selfish dreams,
Now one through grace alone.
How could I now dishonor
The ones that You have loved?
Beneath the cross of Jesus
See the children called by God.
Beneath the cross of Jesus--
The path before the crown--
We follow in His footsteps
Where promised hope is found.
How great the joy before us
To be His perfect bride;
Beneath the cross of Jesus
We will gladly live our lives.

162 DON'T LET ME LOSE MY WONDER [BONUS TRACK]

I've seen days melt into nights in circles of lights,
I've watched a spider spin a star between the window box flowers,
I've heard you laugh and cry in a single sigh,
And a story form within.

Don't let me lose my wonder,
Don't let me lose my wonder.

I saw her broken dreams inside but helping others fly,
I saw his eyes without a doubt though other lights faded out,
And though her calling roared,such graciousness poured
From the vision of her soul.

A baby cried through the dark beneath a jeweled spark,
I knew Your voice upon the hill and heard my lostness still,
I found my home in the light where wrong was made right
And You rose as the morning star.

163 SEE, WHAT A MORNING

See, what a morning, gloriously bright,
With the dawning of hope in Jerusalem;
Folded the grave-clothes, tomb filled with light,
As the angels announce, "Christ is risen!"
See God's salvation plan,
Wrought in love, borne in pain, paid in sacrifice,
Fulfilled in Christ, the Man,
For He lives: Christ is risen from the dead!
See Mary weeping, "Where is He laid?"
As in sorrow she turns from the empty tomb;
Hears a voice speaking, calling her name;
It's the Master, the Lord raised to life again!
The voice that spans the years,
Speaking life, stirring hope, bringing peace to us,
Will sound till He appears,
For He lives: Christ is risen from the dead!
One with the Father, Ancient of Days,
Through the Spirit who clothes faith with certainty.
Honor and blessing, glory and praise
To the King crowned with pow'r and authority!
And we are raised with Him,
Death is dead, love has won, Christ has conquered;
And we shall reign with Him,
For He lives: Christ is risen from the dead!

164 JESUS DRAW ME EVER NEARER

Jesus draw me ever nearer
As I labour through the storm.
You have called me to this passage,
and I'll follow, though I'm worn.

May this journey bring a blessing,
May I rise on wings of faith;
And at the end of my heart's testing,
With Your likeness let me wake.

Jesus guide me through the tempest;
Keep my spirit staid and sure.
When the midnight meets the morning,
Let me love You even more.

Let the treasures of the trial
Form within me as I go -
And at the end of this long passage,
Let me leave them at Your throne.

165 O CHURCH ARISE

O church, arise, and put your armor on;
Hear the call of Christ our captain.
For now the weak can say that they are strong
In the strength that God has given.
With shield of faith and belt of truth,
We'll stand against the devil's lies.
An army bold, whose battle cry is love,
Reaching out to those in darkness.
Our call to war, to love the captive soul,
But to rage against the captor;
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole,
We will fight with faith and valor.
When faced with trials on every side,
We know the outcome is secure.
And Christ will have the prize for which He died:
An inheritance of nations.
Chorus:
Arise, shine for your light has come
Arise, shine for the Risen Son
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride
Arise, o church arise!
Come, see the cross, where love and mercy meet,
As the Son of God is stricken;
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet,
For the Conqueror has risen!
And as the stone is rolled away,
And Christ emerges from the grave,
This victory march continues till the day
Ev'ry eye and heart shall see Him.
So Spirit, come, put strength in every stride;
Give grace for every hurdle.
That we may run with faith to win the prize
Of a servant good and faithful.
As saints of old, still line the way,
Retelling triumphs of His grace,
We hear their calls, and hunger for the day
When with Christ we stand in Glory.
CHORUS

166 COME UNTO JESUS

Come unto Jesus, all you who are weary;
Come to the mercy seat, fervently kneel.
Here bring your wounded hearts, broken and needy;
Come unto Jesus, mighty to heal.
Joy of the comfortless, Light for the straying,
Hope of the penitent, Peace in our strife;
Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying:
"My yoke is easy, my burden is light."
Come unto Jesus,
Come unto Jesus.
Lay down your burdens, He is enough;
Come unto Jesus, rest in His love.
Come taste the Bread of Life, broken for sinners;
Drink from the cup of His promise made sure.
Feast at His table as sons and as daughters;
Grace overflowing is yours evermore.
Come unto Jesus,
Come unto Jesus.
Lay down your burdens, He is enough;
Come unto Jesus, rest in His love.
Come now and follow Him, this life forsaking;
All that was gain, count as nothing but loss.
Trade all this world for His kingdom unfading;
Come unto Jesus, take up your cross;
Come unto Jesus, take up your cross;
Life everlasting He offers to us.
Come unto Jesus,
Come unto Jesus.
Lay down your burdens, He is enough;
Come unto Jesus,
Come unto Jesus.
Lay down your burdens, He is enough;
Come unto Jesus, rest in His love.
Come unto Jesus,
Come unto Jesus.
Lay down your burdens, He is enough;
Come unto Jesus, rest in His love.

167 NOT TO US (ONE NAME FOREVER SHALL BE PRAISED)

Not to us, oh Lord
Not to us, oh Lord
But unto Your name be the glory
From the dawn of time to its setting sun
The name of the Lord shall be praised
One song will ring through the ages
One throne will ever remain
This world will pass and its glories fade
One name forever shall be praised
While the nations rage trusting idols vain
Our God stands alone in the heavens
Robed in majesty hail the highest King
The name of the Lord shall be praised
One song will ring through the ages
One throne will ever remain
This world will pass and its glories fade
One name forever shall be praised
One name forever shall be praised
May Your face be set, may Your blessing rest
Upon us Your people beloved
Mark us by Your grace that the world would say
"The name of the Lord shall be praised!"
One throne will ever remain
This world will pass and its glories fade
One name forever shall be praised
One song will ring through the ages
One throne will ever remain
This world will pass and its glories fade
One name forever shall be praised
One name forever shall be praised
One name forever shall be praised

168 OUR GOD WILL GO BEFORE US

Our God will go before us
And guide us by His presence
What confidence this promise is
We will never walk alone
Through unknown paths, through shadows
Our hearts fear not tomorrow
For every step His faithfulness
Is the truth that lights our way
Our God will go before us
The Lord of Hosts is with us
O praise the One who leads us on
For His grace will bring us home
Though evil forms against us
All heaven will defend us
The gates of hell shall not prevail
For the battle is the Lord's
Our God will go before us
The Lord of Hosts is with us
O praise the One who leads us on
For His grace will bring us home
Now send us with Your presence
And lead us on to heaven
Where songs of sorrow strain no more
And our every breath is praise
O let our every breath be praise
Our God will go before us
The Lord of Hosts is with us
O praise the One who leads us on
For His grace will bring us home
Our God will go before us
The Lord of Hosts is with us
O praise the One who leads us on
For His grace will bring us home
For His grace will bring us home

169 GOD REST YE MERRY GENTLEMEN

God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's pow'r
When we were gone astray
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

In Bethlehem, in Israel
This blessed Babe was born
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn
The which His Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed Angel came
And unto certain Shepherds
Brought tidings of the same
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind
And left their flocks a-feeding
In tempest, storm and wind
And went to Bethlehem straightway
The Son of God to find
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace
This holy tide of Christmas
All others doth deface
O tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
O tidings of comfort and joy

170 SING WE NOW OF CHRISTMAS

Sing we now of Christmas
Noel, sing we here
Hear our grateful praises
To the Babe so dear
Refrain
Sing we Noel, the King is born, Noel
Sing we now of Christmas, sing we now Noel
Angels called to shepherds,
"Leave your flocks at rest,
journey forth to Bethlehem,
find the lambkin blest"

171 ELIZABETH

Elizabeth, there's an echo in your voice I've heard before
Such emptiness, all the years of crying out for something more
But you have lived to see
that joy comes in the morning
Come and lay your head
on His promises
Oh find your rest, Elizabeth
Elizabeth, feel the baby dance for joy within your womb
Magnificent, Mary's Son is sent to overcome the tomb
But you have lived to see
that joy comes in the morning
Come and lay your head
on His promises
Oh find your rest, Elizabeth
Woman after woman who will follow
Will carry beauty and a longing of their own
When I hear the rhythm of your name, oh
I remember once again
That none of us will ache without a living hope
Elizabeth, oh blessed is the one who has believed
In the Rising Sun who will guide our feet into the path of peace
For we will live to see
that joy comes in the morning
Come and lay your head
on His promises
Oh find your rest, Elizabeth

172 O COME O COME EMMANUEL

O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear
Rejoice, rejoice
Emmanuel shall come to thee,
O Israel

173 AN IRISH CHRISTMAS BLESSING

Now may the fragrance of His peace
Soar through your heart like the dove released
Hide in His wings oh weary, distant soul
He'll guide your spirit home
And may His love poured from on high
Flow to the depths of your deepest sigh
Oh come and drink from the only living stream
And on His shoulder lean
And may the hope that will not deceive
Through every pain bring eternal ease
There is no night that can steal the promises
His coming brings to us
So may His joy rush over you
Delight in the path He has called you to
May all your steps walk in Heaven's endless light
Beyond this Christmas night (Make your sole purpose Christ)

174 O COME ALL YE FAITHFUL

O come, all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels!
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing, all ye citizens of Heaven above
Glory to God
Glory in the highest
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

175 COMPLETELY KNOWN, COMPLETELY LOVED

Completely known, completely loved
My heart is seen by God above
Should I now run? Dare hide my face?
When in His eyes there is only grace

Completely free, the shame is gone
The highest Judge took all my wrongs
And set them on His only Son
He bore my sin, I bear His love

Completely known, completely loved
I'm covered by my Savior's blood
I'm robed in white and God is pleased
To see His Son, when He looks on me

Completely His, how can it be?
That God would set His heart on me
Loved not for works that I have done
But long before time had begun

Completely known, completely loved
I'm covered by my Savior's blood
I'm robed in white and God is pleased
To see His Son, when He looks on me

Completely saved, the work is done
The curse, the grave, is overcome
For with that dawn there rose a King!
Now heaven's smile shines over me

Completely known, completely loved
I'm covered by my Savior's blood
I'm robed in white and God is pleased
To see His Son, when He looks on me

176 RUN AND RUN (CHRIST IS ALL MY RIGHTEOUSNESS)

Run and run the law demands
But gives me neither feet nor hands
Better news, the gospel brings
It bids me fly, it gives me wings
Bearing shame and all my sin
There in my place He stood condemned
Here I stand now justified
My guilt is His, His grace is mine
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul, praise the Lord
Now and forevermore my heart confess
Christ is all my righteousness
Christ is all my righteousness
My accuser, he may roar
Of countless sins that I have done
These I know and thousands more
Behold, my God, He knows not one
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul, praise the Lord
Now and forevermore my heart confess
Christ is all my righteousness
Christ is all my righteousness
When I stand before the throne
There dressed in beauty not my own
Then, Lord, shall I fully know
Not til that day how much I owe
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul, praise the Lord
Now and forevermore my heart confess
Christ is all my righteousness
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul, praise the Lord
For now this sinner's heart has found its' rest
Christ is all my righteousness

177 THE MATCHLESS NAME OF JESUS

Praise to the matchless name of Jesus
Sing of His grace forevermore
Raise now an endless hallelujah
To the matchless name of Jesus Christ the Lord
We sing the name, the matchless name of Jesus
We hymn the name the angels long adore
From age to age, one chorus rings forevermore
To the matchless name of Jesus Christ the Lord
Come to the fountain of forgiveness
Run to the light of His great love
Join in the joy of this salvation
Now that echoes through the endless realms above
We sing the name, the matchless name of Jesus
We hymn the name the angels long adore
From age to age, one chorus rings forevermore
To the matchless name of Jesus Christ the Lord
Go to the corners of creation
Christ be the name that we proclaim
Go til His glory fills the nations
And the heavens with His everlasting praise
We sing the name, the matchless name of Jesus
We hymn the name the angels long adore
From age to age, one chorus rings forevermore
To the matchless name of Jesus Christ the Lord
All blessing and honor
And praise be to the Lamb
All glory forever more
Amen amen amen

178 GOD OF EVERY GRACE

O let not this world of sorrows
Steal my only hope away
For the power of Your gospel
Shines within this jar of clay
In affliction You bring wisdom
That my comforts can displace
How my true and greatest treasure
Is in You the God of grace
Now to the God of every grace
Who counts my tears, who holds my days
I sing through sorrows, sing with faith
O praise the God of every grace
Weary with the weight I carry
Give me wings of faith to rise
For You know each grief that lingers
Through the watches of the night
Surely You have borne our sufferings
At the cross took up our pain
And You lead us on to glory
As we trust You, God of grace
Now to the God of every grace
Who counts my tears, who holds my days
I sing through sorrows, sing with faith
O praise the God of every grace
There's a dawning hope before us
That I know is soon to break
As I wait upon Your mercy
Which will swallow every ache
Cries of joy and songs of victory
When we enter heaven's gates
All Your children home together
All with You the God of grace
Now to the God of every grace
Who counts my tears, who holds my days
I sing through sorrows, sing with faith
O praise the God of every grace
Now to the God of every grace
Who counts my tears, who holds my days
I sing through sorrows, sing with faith
O praise the God of every grace
O praise the God of every grace
O praise the God of every grace

179 BRING PRAISES

If we could count the blessings God has given
If we should number every grace
Our hearts would burst within with pure thanksgiving
Now, let our voices do the same

Bring praises, bring praises
Forever to the Lord
Bring praises, bring praises
Together
To Him who is worthy, to Him be endless thanks
Forever to His name bring praise

If we could see the ways that God is working
If we could trace His sovereign hand
What mind could grasp the height of that great wisdom?
Oh, who of us could understand?

Bring praises, bring praises
Forever to the Lord
Bring praises, bring praises
Together
To Him who is worthy, to Him be endless thanks
Forever to His name bring praise

If we could now repay the Lord of heaven
What is that gift that we would bring?
All that is ours is that which once was given
Oh, let our grateful hearts now sing
With joy we give this offering

Bring praises, bring praises
Forever to the Lord
Bring praises, bring praises
Together
To Him who is worthy, to Him be endless thanks
Forever to His name

180 SOLO EN JESUS (FEATURING CHRISTINE D'CLARIO)

Solo en Jesus esta mi fe
El es mi luz, fuerza y cancion
Piedra Angular, firme Sosten
Inconmovible proteccion
Cuan alto amor, profunda paz
En el temor o adversidad
Consolador, mi todo es El
En Su amor me sostendre

Solo en Jesus, quien se encarno
La plenitud de Dios llevo
Su don de rectitud y amor
Su propio pueblo rechazo
Mas en la cruz, cuando murio
La ira de Dios El propicio
Pues mi pecado El cargo
Y por Su muerte vivo yo

La Luz del mundo padecio
Y en una tumba reposo
Pero el tercer dia llego
Cristo el Senor resucito
Hoy en victoria reina El
Perdio el pecado su poder
El mio es, y suyo soy
Pues con Su sangre me compro

Ya no habra mas condenacion
Cristo es mi plena libertad
No temere, seguro estoy
Mi vida en su mano esta
Ningun poder, ningun afan
De El me puede arrebatar
Hasta que llegue a estar con El
En Su poder me sostendre

181 I WILL WAIT FOR YOU (PSALM 130)

Lord, from the depths I call to You
Lord, hear me from on high
And give attention to my voice
When I for mercy cry

Out of the depths I cry to You
In darkest places I will call
Incline Your ear to me anew
And hear my cry for mercy, Lord

Were You to count my sinful ways
How could I come before Your throne
Yet full forgiveness meets my gaze
I stand redeemed by grace alone

CHORUS
I will wait for You
I will wait for You
On Your word, I will rely
I will wait for You
Surely wait for You
Till my soul is satisfied

So put your hope in God alone
Take courage in His power to save
Completely and forever won
By Christ emerging from the grave

Now He has come to make a way
And God Himself has paid the price
That all who trust in Him today
Find healing in His sacrifice

CHORUS
I will wait for You
I will wait for You
Through the storm and through the night
I will wait for You
Surely wait for You
For Your love is my delight

I pray my soul waits for the Lord
My hope is in His word
More than the watchman waits for dawn
My soul waits for the Lord

182 JESUS CALMS THE STORM (HYMN FOR ANXIOUS LITTLE HEARTS)

When my heart is filled with fear
Like a stormy sky
Jesus says "be not afraid"
He is at my side

Chorus
There's a rock where I can go
Keeps me safe and this I know
Deep within my troubled soul
Jesus calms the storm

When my thoughts are tossed and turned
Like a raging sea
I will listen to His voice
He will comfort me

Chorus
There's a rock where I can go
Keeps me safe and this I know
Deep within my troubled soul
Jesus calms the storm

When I feel the shame of sin
Like a crashing wave 
My Redeemer rescues me
By His grace I'm saved

Chorus
There's a rock where I can go
Keeps me safe and this I know
Deep within my troubled soul
Jesus calms the storm

He who rules the wind and waves
Soon will come again
Oh take courage little heart
Every storm will end

Chorus
There's a rock where I can go
Keeps me safe and this I know
Deep within my troubled soul
Jesus calms the storm

There's a rock where I can go
Keeps me safe and this I know
Deep within my troubled soul
Jesus calms the storm
Jesus calms the storm

183 COME PEOPLE OF THE RISEN KING

Come, people of the Risen King,
Who delight to bring Him praise;
Come all and tune your hearts to sing
To the Morning Star of grace.

We will lift our eyes to Him,
Where steady arms of mercy reach
To gather children in.

REFRAIN
Rejoice, Rejoice! Let every tongue rejoice!
One heart, one voice; O Church of Christ, rejoice!

Come, those whose joy is morning sun,
And those weeping through the night;

And those struggling in the fight.
For His perfect love will never change,
And His mercies never cease,
But follow us through all our days
With the certain hope of peace.

Come, young and old from every land -
Men and women of the faith;
Come, those with full or empty hands -
Find the riches of His grace.
Over all the world, His people sing -
Shore to shore we hear them call
The Truth that cries through every age:
"Our God is all in all

Crown Him with many crowns
The Lamb upon His throne
Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own
Awake my soul and sing
Of Him who died for thee
And hail Him as thy matchless King
Through all eternity

Crown Him the Lord of life
Who triumphed o'er the grave
And rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save
His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die

Crown Him the Lord of love
Behold His hands and side
Rich wounds yet visible above
In beauty glorified
No angel in the sky
Can fully bear that sight
But downward bends each burning eye
At mysteries so bright

Crown Him the Lord of peace
Whose power a sceptre sways
From pole to pole
That wars may cease
And all be prayer and praise
His reign shall know no end
And round His pierced feet
Fair flowers of paradise extend
Their fragrance ever sweet

Crown Him the Lord of years
The Potentate of time
Creator of the rolling spheres
Ineffably sublime
All hail Redeemer hail
For Thou hast died for me
Thy praise shall never never fail
Throughout eternity

189 THERE IS A HOPE (THERE IS HOPE)

There is a hope that burns within my heart
That gives me strength for every passing day
A glimpse of glory now revealed in meagre part
Yet drives all doubt away

I stand in Christ with sins forgiven
And Christ in me the hope of heaven
My highest calling and my deepest joy
To make His will my home

There is a hope that lifts my weary head
A consolation strong against despair
That when the world has plunged me in its deepest pit
I find the Savior there

Through present sufferings future's fear
He whispers courage in my ear
For I am safe in everlasting arms
And they will lead me home

There is a hope that stands the test of time
That lifts my eyes beyond the beckoning grave
To see the matchless beauty of a day divine
When I behold His face

When sufferings cease and sorrows die
And every longing satisfied
Then joy unspeakable will flood my soul
For I am truly home

When sufferings cease and sorrows die
And every longing satisfied
Then joy unspeakable will flood my soul
For I am truly home

194 CREATION SINGS THE FATHER'S SONG

Creation sings the Father's song;
He calls the sun to wake the dawn
And run the course of day
Till evening falls in crimson rays.
His fingerprints in flakes of snow,
His breath upon this spinning globe,
He charts the eagle's flight;
Commands the newborn baby's cry.

CHORUS
Hallelujah! Let all creation stand and sing,
"Hallelujah!" Fill the earth with songs of worship;
Tell the wonders of creation's King.

Creation gazed upon His face;
The ageless One in time's embrace
Unveiled the Father's plan
Of reconciling God and man.
A second Adam walked the earth,
Whose blameless life would break the curse,
Whose death would set us free
To live with Him eternally.

Creation longs for His return,
When Christ shall reign upon the earth;
The bitter wars that rage
Are birth pains of a coming age.
When He renews the land and sky,
All heav'n will sing and earth reply
With one resplendent theme: The glories of our God and King!

195 STILL MY SOUL, BE STILL

Still my soul be still
And do not fear
Though winds of change may rage tomorrow
God is at your side
No longer dread
The fires of unexpected sorrow

God You are my God
And I will trust in You and not be shaken
Lord of peace renew
A steadfast spirit within me
To rest in You alone

Still my soul be still
Do not be moved
By lesser lights and fleeting shadows
Hold onto His ways
With shield of faith
Against temptations flaming arrows

Still my soul be still
Do not forsake
The Truth you learned in the beginning
Wait upon the Lord
And hope will rise As stars appear when day is dimming

196 BEHOLD THE LAMB (COMMUNION HYMN)

Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away,
Slain for us - and we remember
The promise made that all who come in faith
Find forgiveness at the cross.
So we share in this bread of life,
And we drink of His sacrifice
As a sign of our bonds of peace
Around the table of the King.

The body of our Saviour Jesus Christ,
Torn for you - eat and remember
The wounds that heal, the death that brings us life
Paid the price to make us one.
So we share in this bread of life,
And we drink of His sacrifice
As a sign of our bonds of love
Around the table of the King.

The blood that cleanses every stain of sin,
Shed for you - drink and remember
He drained death's cup that all may enter in
To receive the life of God.
So we share in this bread of life,
And we drink of His sacrifice
As a sign of our bonds of grace
Around the table of the King.

And so with thankfulness and faith we rise
To respond, - and to remember
Our call to follow in the steps of Christ
As His body here on earth.
As we share in His suffering
We proclaim Christ will come again!
And we'll join in the feast of heaven
Around the table of the King

197 ALL AROUND THE WORLD

All around the world the Kingdom cry resounds
From mountain town to desert plain,
From city to the shore.
Truth will not be bound by walls upon the earth.
From every nation, tribe and tongue
God calls His people forth

All praise to the King
Of the new Jerusalem
Where all of the saints
With one voice will worship the Lamb
Will forever worship the Lamb

Restless is the world, unchanging is His Word
Unshaken is our confidence
In Christ the Risen Lord
All who bear His name unite to breathe as one
We share the joys and pains we face
And pray 'His Kingdom come'

Boldly we proclaim the power of the cross
In every language, art and deed
We tell the wonder of grace
Then when Christ returns, His church will rise adorned
With treasure brought from every land
To glorify the Lord

198 EVERY PROMISE OF YOUR WORD

From the breaking of the dawn to the setting of the sun,
I will stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.
Words of power, strong to save, that will never pass away,
I will stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.
For Your covenant is sure,
And on this I am secure--
I can stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.

When I stumble and I sin, condemnation pressing in,

Ev'ry work begun in me--

Grace for all who will believe--
We will stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.

199 COMPASSION HYMN

There is an everlasting kindness
You lavished on us
When the Radiance of heaven Came to rescue the lost;
You called the sheep without a shepherd
To leave their distress
For your streams of forgiveness
And the shade of Your rest.

And with compassion for the hurting,
You reached out Your hand
As the lame ran to meet You
And the dead breathed again;
You saw behind the eyes of sorrow
And shared in our tears,
Heard the sigh of the weary,
Let the children draw near.

CHORUS
What boundless love,
What fathomless grace
You have shown us, O God of compassion!
Each day we live
An offering of praise
As we show to the world Your compassion.

We stood beneath the cross of Calvary
And gazed on Your face
At the thorns of oppression
And the wounds of disgrace,
For surely You have borne our suffering
And carried our grief
As You pardoned the scoffer
And showed grace to the thief.

How beautiful the feet that carry
This gospel of peace
To the fields of injustice
And the valleys of need--
To be a voice of hope and healing,
To answer the cries
Of the hungry and helpless
With the mercy of Christ.

200 WHEN TRIALS COME

When trials come no longer fear
For in the pain our God draws near
To fire a faith worth more than gold
And there His faithfulness is told
And there His faithfulness is told

Within the night I know Your peace
The breath of God brings strength to me
And new each morning mercy flows
As treasures of the darkness grow
As treasures of the darkness grow

I turn to Wisdom not my own
For every battle You have known
My confidence will rest in You
Your love endures Your ways are good
Your love endures Your ways are good

When I am weary with the cost
I see the triumph of the cross
So in its shadow I shall run
Till He completes the work begun
Till He completes the work begun

One day all things will be made new
I'll see the hope You called me to
And in your kingdom paved with gold
I'll praise your faithfulness of old
I'll praise your faithfulness of old

201 BENEDICTION (MAY THE PEACE OF GOD)

May the peace of God, our heav'nly Father,
And the grace of Christ, the risen Son,
And the fellowship of God the Spirit
Keep our hearts and minds within His love.

REFRAIN
And to Him be praise for His glorious reign;
From the depths of earth to the heights of heaven
We declare the name of the Lamb once slain--
Christ eternal, the King of Kings.

May this peace which passes understanding,
And this grace which makes us what we are,
And this fellowship of His communion,
Make us one in spirit and in heart.

202 WHAT GRACE IS MINE

What grace is mine that He who dwells in endless light
Called through the night to find my distant soul
And from his scars poured mercy that would plead for me
That I might live and in his name be known

So I will go wherever He is calling me
I lose my life to find my life in Him
I give my all to gain the hope that never dies
I bow my heart, take up my cross and follow Him

What grace is mine to know His breath alive in me
Beneath his wings my wakened soul may soar
All fear can flee for death's dark night is overcome
My Saviour lives and reigns forevermore

So I will go wherever He is calling me
I lose my life to find my life in Him
I give my all to gain the hope that never dies
I bow my heart, take up my cross and follow Him

203 ALL PEOPLE THAT ON EARTH DO DWELL

All people that on earth do dwell
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice
Him serve with mirth, His praise forth tell
Come ye before Him and rejoice

Know that the Lord is God indeed
Without our aid He did us make
We are His flock, He doth us feed
And for His sheep He doth us take

O enter then His gates with praise
Approach with joy His courts unto
Praise, laud, and bless His name always
For it is seemly so to do

Because the Lord our God is good
His mercy is forever sure
His truth at all times firmly stood
And shall from age to age endure

Praise God from Whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
Praise Him above ye heavenly host
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost

204 ON JORDAN'S STORMY BANKS

On Jordan's Stormy Banks
On Jordan's stormy banks I stand
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan's fair and happy land
Where my possessions lie

All o'er those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day
There God the Son forever reigns
And scatters night away

CHORUS
I am bound (I am bound)
I am bound (I am bound)
I am bound for the promised land
I am bound (I am bound)
I am bound (I am bound)
I am bound for the promised land

No chilling winds nor poisonous breath
Can reach that healthful shore
Sickness, sorrow, pain and death
Are felt and feared no more

CHORUS

When shall I reach that happy place
And be forever blessed?
When shall I see my Father's face
And in His bosom rest?

CHORUS

205 I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVES

I know that my Redeemer lives
What hope this sweet assurance gives
That he who gave his life for me
Arose with healing in his wings
He lives, the tomb is empty still
Redemption's promise he fulfilled
No condemnation now remains
The stone of death is rolled away

CHORUS

My redeemer lives
My redeemer lives
On heaven's throne, and in my very soul
I know that my Redeemer lives

I know that my Redeemer lives
And all my life is bound to his
In realms above, he intercedes
Our sinless Savior, perfect priest
No fear can follow where he guides
His constant presence is my light
No power on earth or heav'n above
Can separate us from his love

REPEAT CHORUS

I know that my redeemer lives
In life and death I trust in him
My soul secure, my future safe
He'll not forsake me to the grave
He lives and He will not delay
My eyes will wake to brightest day
And in my flesh I'll see him stand
When Christ in glory comes again
And every eye will see him stand
When Christ in glory comes again

REPEAT CHORUS

On heaven's throne, and in my very soul
I know that my Redeemer lives.

Fixed my first and second birth
Now my life to Him I owe

Times to taste a Savior's love
All must come and last and end
As shall please my heavenly Friend

Where Thou leadest me
I dare not find complaint
For Thou hast never left
Nor will for all my days
Thy presence is my good
And it shall ever be
I will go where Thou leadest me

Sovereign is Thy hand
To guide me when I'm worn
Thy good and perfect will
Holds fast through every storm
What time I am afraid
My faith looks up to Thee
I will trust where Thou leadest me

On the mountain high
Through the valley deep
I will go where Thou leadest me

O Shepherd keep me near
For I am prone to stray
The frailty of my flesh
Seeks refuge in Thy grace
This promise is my peace
My soul is safe in Thee
I will rest as Thou leadest me

On the mountain high
Through the valley deep
I will go where Thou leadest me

On the mountain high
Through the valley deep
I will go where Thou leadest me

Savior light my path
Until that final day
If Thou art Lord of life
Why should I fear the grave?
Proud death has lost its sting
For all eternity
I will rise where Thou leadest me
Home with Christ where Thou leadest me

On the mountain high
Through the valley deep
I will go where Thou leadest me

On the mountain high
Through the valley deep
I will go where Thou leadest me

208 DEAR REFUGE OF MY WEARY SOUL

Dear refuge of my weary soul
On Thee, when sorrows rise
On Thee, when waves of trouble roll
My fainting hope relies
To Thee I tell each rising grief
For Thou alone canst heal
Thy Word can bring a sweet relief
For every pain I feel

But oh! When gloomy doubts prevail
I fear to call Thee mine
The springs of comfort seem to fail
And all my hopes decline
Yet gracious God, where shall I flee?
Thou art my only trust
And still my soul would cleave to Thee
Though prostrate in the dust

Hast Thou not bid me seek Thy face
And shall I seek in vain?
And can the ear of sov'reign grace
Be deaf when I complain?
No, still the ear of sov'reign grace
Attends the mourner's prayer
O may I ever find access
To breathe my sorrows there

Thy mercy seat is open still
Here let my soul retreat
With humble hope attend Thy will
And wait beneath Thy feet
Thy mercy seat is open still
Here let my soul retreat
With humble hope attend Thy will
And wait beneath Thy feet

209 WHEN I SURVEY THE WONDROUS CROSS

When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died
My richest gain I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
Save in the death of Christ my God
All the vain things that charm me most
I sacrifice them to His blood

See from His head, His hands, His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown

Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all

Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all

210 I WILL WAIT FOR YOU (PSALM 130)

INTRO
Lord, from the depths I call to You
Lord, hear me from on high
And give attention to my voice
When I for mercy cry

Vs 1
Out of the depths I cry to You
In darkest places I will call
Incline Your ear to me anew
And hear my cry for mercy, Lord

Vs 2
Were You to count my sinful ways
How could I come before Your throne
Yet full forgiveness meets my gaze
I stand redeemed by grace alone

CHORUS
I will wait for You
I will wait for You
On Your word, I will rely
I will wait for You
Surely wait for You
Till my soul is satisfied

Vs 3
So put your hope in God alone
Take courage in His power to save
Completely and forever won
By Christ emerging from the grave

Vs 4
Now He has come to make a way
And God Himself has paid the price
That all who trust in Him today
Find healing in His sacrifice

CHORUS
I will wait for You
I will wait for You
Through the storm and through the night
I will wait for You
Surely wait for You
For Your love is my delight

OUTRO
I pray my soul waits for the Lord
My hope is in His word
More than the watchman waits for dawn
My soul waits for the Lord

211 MAGNIFICENT, MARVELOUS, MATCHLESS LOVE

Magnificent, marvelous, matchless love; too vast and astounding to tell
Forever existing in worlds above, now offered and given to all.
Oh, fountain of beauty eternal; the Father, the Spirit, the Son.
Sufficient and endlessly generous, magnificent, marvelous, matchless love.

Creation is brimming with thankfulness, the mountains, exultant they stand;
The seasons rejoice in Your faithfulness, all life is sustained by Your hand.
You crown every meadow with color; You paint every shade in the sky;
Each day the dawn wakes as an encore of magnificent, marvelous, matchless love.

Chorus
How great, how sure; His love endures forevermore.
Magnificent, marvelous, matchless love.

What grace, that You entered our brokenness; You came in the fullness of time
How far we had fallen from righteousness, but not from the mercies of Christ.
Your cross is our door to redemption; Your death is our fullness of life.
That day, how forgiveness flowed as a flood: magnificent, marvelous, matchless love.

How great, how sure; His love endures forevermore.
Magnificent, marvelous, matchless love.

United in Your resurrection, You lift us to infinite heights
Could anything sever or take us from magnificent, marvelous, matchless love

How great, how sure; His love endures forevermore.
Magnificent, marvelous, matchless love.

214 MY DWELLING PLACE (PSALM 91) - FEAT. PHIL KEAGGY

My dwelling place is God Most High
My refuge and my fortress
When plague and pestilence draw nigh
I'm hidden in His presence
When terrors fall and arrows fly
His shield will be my safety
When stones across my pathway lie
On angels' wings I'm carried

My dwelling place is God Most High
A present help in danger
I rest secure in Love's pure light,
Beneath My Master's favor
He freed me from the fowler's snare
Where sin and shame had bound me
Deceived I made my refuge there,
Till fearless He came for me

Wonderful, powerful, my hope and my defender
Mighty God, Emmanuel, my dwelling place forever

My dwelling place is God Most High
I'll never seek another
For I am His and He is mine
My heart He'll keep forever
I know the Name on Whom I call
He promises to answer
With life he satisfies my soul
And crowns me with his pleasure

215 GOD BE MERCIFUL TO ME (PSALM 51) - FEAT. CINDY MORGAN

God be merciful to me
On Thy grace, I rest my plea
Plenteous in compassion, Thou
Blot out my transgressions now
Wash me, make me pure within
Cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin
Wash me, make me pure within
Cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin

Broken, humbled to the dust
By Thy wrath and judgement just
Let my contrite heart rejoice
And in gladness heed Thy voice
From my sins, O hide Thy face
Blot them out in boundless grace
From my sins, O hide Thy face
Blot them out in boundless grace

Gracious God, my heart renew
Make my spirit right and true
Cast me not away from Thee
Let Thy Spirit dwell in me
Thy salvation's joy impart
Steadfast make my willing heart
Thy salvation's joy impart
Steadfast make my willing heart

Sinners then shall learn from me
And return, O God to Thee
Savior, all my guilt remove
And my tongue shall sing Thy love
Touch my silent lips, O Lord
And my mouth shall praise accord
Touch my silent lips, O Lord
And my mouth shall praise accord
And my mouth shall praise accord

God be merciful to me

216 HIS MERCY IS MORE - FEAT. MATT BOSWELL & MATT PAPA

Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore;

His mercy is more.
Stronger than darkness; new every morn;
Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more.

What Father, so tender, is calling us home.
He welcomes, the weakest, the vilest, the poor;
Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more.

Vs 3
What riches of kindness He lavished on us;
His blood was the payment, His life was the cost.
We stood 'neath a debt we could never afford;
Our sins, they are many, His mercy is more.

221 PSALM 23 - FEAT. STUART TOWNEND

The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want;
He makes me lie in pastures green.
He leads me by the still, still waters,
His goodness restores my soul.

And I will trust in You alone,
And I will trust in You alone,
For Your endless mercy follows me,
Your goodness will lead me home.

He guides my ways in righteousness,
And He anoints my head with oil,
And my cup, it overflows with joy,
I feast on His pure delights.

And though I walk the darkest path,
I will not fear the evil one,
For You are with me, and Your rod and staff
Are the comfort I need to know.

222 YOU HAVE SEARCHED ME (PSALM 139)

You have searched me and You know me
You know when I sit down and when I rise
Lord, you made me, understand me
You see where I walk and where I lie
Before a word is on my tongue
Behold, O Lord, you know it all
Ever with me, all around me
To think on it is too wonderful

Where could I go from Your Spirit?
If up to the heavens, You are there
If I dwell in deepest darkness
The light of Your presence finds me there
If I should rise on wings of dawn
Or settle on a distant shore,
Even then Your hand will guide me
You're holding me fast forevermore

Refrain
Search me, know my heart
Test my attitudes
Save me from where I have strayed
To walk in Your everlasting Way

For you saw my unformed body
You knit me within the secret place
I will praise you for I have been
So fearfully, wonderfully made
How vast the sum of all Your thoughts
Oh, how much higher are all Your ways
I will turn from all that's evil
To live in Your goodness all my days

229 CONSIDER THE STARS FEAT. JOHN PATITUCCI

Consider the stars in the sky;
Look up and wonder, can you count their number?
Consider the stars in the sky;
Umbrella to hide in, a dance floor of heaven.

Do not be afraid
Do not be afraid

Consider the stars in the sky;
When it is darkest they shine out the brightest
Consider the stars in the sky
In every anguish, Oh, child take courage

Do not be afraid
Do not be afraid
He who made all of this, and who holds all of this,
Holds you in his hands

Do not be afraid
Do not be afraid

Consider the stars in the sky;
Diamond in a ring. Over the Child King.
Consider the stars in the sky;
Grace He had promised, coming to find us

Do not be afraid
Do not be afraid
He who made all of this, says "You're worth more than this,"
And holds you in his hands

Through the darkness be Thou near me;
Watch my sleep till morning light.

Chorus:
When I'm troubled and afraid
I will trust in Thee and pray
Jesus, tender Shepherd hear me
Bless thy little lamb tonight
Bless thy little lamb tonight

All this day Thy hand has led me,
And I thank Thee for Thy care;
Thou hast clothed me, warmed and fed me,
Listen to my evening prayer.

Bless the friends I love so well;
At life's end, take me to Heaven
Happy there with Thee to dwell.

CHORUS

231 LET THE EARTH RESOUND

Let the earth resound with songs of praise
To the Father's power and love;
For the One who set each star in place
Chose to set His heart on us.
To the One whose might gives victory,
Yet whose mercies never cease;
As the tapestry of history
Tells the story of His grace.

King immortal, Faithful God
Crowned with splendour, rich in love.
Let the heavens and the earth resound
With songs of praise to You.

Let the earth be stilled before the sight
Of a Father's sacrifice -
That revealed the depths of love divine
In the face of Jesus Christ.
Through a life of full obedience
And a death in agony,
He removed the rebel's punishment
And He set the prisoner free

Let the earth resound with songs of faith
At the wonder yet to come,
When all sin and pain are put to death
And the church and Christ are one.
When we stand as God's great family
And we meet the Father's gaze,
And we share in His eternal joy
As we join in ceaseless praise.

232 THOU WHO WAST RICH BEYOND ALL SPLENDOR

Thou who wast rich beyond all splendour,
All for love's sake becamest poor;
Thrones for a manger didst surrender,
Sapphire-paved courts for stable floor.
Thou who wast rich beyond all splendour,
All for love's sake becomes poor.

Thou who art God beyond all praising,
All for love's sake becamest man;
Stooping so low, but sinners raising
Heavenwards by thine eternal plan.
Thou who art God beyond all praising,
All for love's sake becamest man.

Thou who art love beyond all telling,
Saviour and King, we worship thee.
Emmanuel, within us dwelling,
Make us what thou wouldst have us be.
Thou who art love beyond all telling,
Saviour and King, we worship thee.

233 GOOD SHEPHERD OF MY SOUL

Good Shepherd of my soul
Come dwell within me.
Take all I am and mould
Your likeness in me.
Before the cross of Christ
This is my sacrifice:
A life laid down
And ready to follow.

The troubled find their peace
In true surrender.
The prisoners their release
From chains of anger.
In springs of living grace
I find a resting place
To rise refreshed,
Determined to follow.

I'll walk this narrow road
With Christ before me
Where thorns and thistles grow
And cords ensnare me.
Though doubted and denied
He never leaves my side
But lifts my head
And calls me to follow.

And when my days are gone
My strength is failing
He'll carry me along
Through death's unveiling
Earth's struggles overcome
Heav'n's journey just begun
To search Christ's depths
And ever to follow.

When once I saw the Lord
Where is the soul refreshing view
Living in His Word

O fire of God come burn in me
Renew a holy passion
Til Christ my deepest longing be

He delights to bring us peace
Tender shepherd, mighty Savior
Rest in him

How sure, his compassion for us
Oh how deep is his love,
So come, come to Jesus, and rest in him

Are you hopeless, are you guilty
Caught in shame for all your sin?
He pursues you, to forgive you
Rest in Him
He has paid for every failure
Mercy flows in endless streams
Come and follow, freedom calls you
Rest in Him

 Are you waiting, in your sorrows
For this broken world to heal?
He is coming, soon returning
Rest in Him
We will see him, We will know him
O what heights of grace revealed
From his kindness, every promise
Then fulfilled
Trust in Jesus, he will keep us
To the end

238 BY FAITH

By faith we see the hand of God
In the light of creation's grand design
In the lives of those who prove His faithfulness
Who walk by faith and not by sight

By faith our fathers roamed the earth
With the power of His promise in their hearts
Of a holy city built by God's own hand
A place where peace and justice reign

We will stand as children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward
Till the race is finished and the work is done
We'll walk by faith and not by sight

By faith the prophets saw a day
When the longed-for Messiah would appear
With the power to break the chains of sin and death
And rise triumphant from the grave

By faith the church was called to go
In the power of the Spirit to the lost
To deliver captives and to preach good news
In every corner of the earth

We will stand as children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward
Till the race is finished and the work is done
We'll walk by faith and not by sight

By faith this mountain shall be moved
And the power of the gospel shall prevail
For we know in Christ all things are possible
For all who call upon His name

We will stand as children of the promise
We will fix our eyes on Him our soul's reward
Till the race is finished and the work is done
We'll walk by faith and not by sight

239 SPEAK O LORD

Speak, O Lord, as we come to You
To receive the food of Your Holy Word.
Take Your truth, plant it deep in us;
Shape and fashion us in Your likeness,
That the light of Christ might be seen today
In our acts of love and our deeds of faith.
Speak, O Lord, and fulfill in us
All Your purposes for Your glory.

Teach us, Lord, full obedience,
Holy reverence, true humility;
Test our thoughts and our attitudes
In the radiance of Your purity.
Cause our faith to rise; cause our eyes to see
Your majestic love and authority.
Words of pow'r that can never fail--
Let their truth prevail over unbelief.

Speak, O Lord, and renew our minds;
Help us grasp the heights of Your plans for us--
Truths unchanged from the dawn of time
That will echo down through eternity.
And by grace we'll stand on Your promises,
And by faith we'll walk as You walk with us.
Speak, O Lord, till Your church is built
And the earth is filled with Your glory.

240 OH HOW GOOD IT IS

Oh how good it is
When the family of God
Dwells together in spirit
In faith and unity.
Where the bonds of peace,
Of acceptance and love
Are the fruit of His presence
Here among us.

CHORUS
So with one voice we'll sing to the Lord
And with one heart we'll live out His word
Till the whole earth sees
The Redeemer has come
For He dwells in the presence of His people.

Oh how good it is
On this journey we share
To rejoice with the happy
And weep with those who mourn.
For the weak find strength
The afflicted find grace
When we offer the blessing
Of belonging.

CHORUS

Oh how good it is
To embrace His command
To prefer one another
Forgive as He forgives.
When we live as one
We all share in the love
Of the Son with the Father
And the Spirit.

CHORUS

241 THE POWER OF THE CROSS (WITH WHEN I SURVEY THE WONDROUS CROSS)

Oh, to see the dawn
Of the darkest day:
Christ on the road to Calvary.
Tried by sinful men,
Torn and beaten, then
Nailed to a cross of wood.

CHORUS:
This, the pow'r of the cross:
Christ became sin for us;
Took the blame, bore the wrath--
We stand forgiven at the cross.

Oh, to see the pain
Written on Your face,
Bearing the awesome weight of sin.
Ev'ry bitter thought,
Ev'ry evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained brow.

Now the daylight flees;
Now the ground beneath
Quakes as its Maker bows His head.
Curtain torn in two,
Dead are raised to life;
"Finished!" the vict'ry cry.

Oh, to see my name
Written in the wounds,
For through Your suffering I am free.
Death is crushed to death;
Life is mine to live,
Won through Your selfless love.

FINAL CHORUS:
This, the pow'r of the cross:
Son of God--slain for us.
What a love! What a cost!
We stand forgiven at the cross.

242 KYRIE ELEISON

Kyrie eleison; have mercy.
Christe eleison; have mercy.
Kyrie eleison; have mercy.
Christe eleison; have mercy.

As we come before You
With the needs of our world,
We confess our failures and our sin,
For our words are many
Yet our deeds have been few;
Fan the fire of compassion
Once again.

CHORUS

When the cries of victims
Go unheard in the land,
And the scars of war refuse to heal,
Will we stand for justice
To empower the weak
Til their bonds of oppression
Are no more?

CHORUS

If we love our God with all our
Heart, mind, and strength,
And we love our Neighbors as ourselves,
Then this law of love
Will heal the nations of earth,
And the glory of Christ Will be revealed.

CHORUS

Lord, renew our vision
To be Christ where we live,
To reach out in mercy to the lost;
For each cup of kindness
To the least in our midst
Is an offering of worship
To the throne.

243 O CHURCH ARISE

O church, arise, and put your armor on;
Hear the call of Christ our captain.
For now the weak can say that they are strong
In the strength that God has given.
With shield of faith and belt of truth,
We'll stand against the devil's lies.
An army bold, whose battle cry is love,
Reaching out to those in darkness.

Our call to war, to love the captive soul,
But to rage against the captor;
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole,
We will fight with faith and valor.
When faced with trials on every side,
We know the outcome is secure.
And Christ will have the prize for which He died:
An inheritance of nations.

Chorus:
Arise, shine for your light has come
Arise, shine for the Risen Son
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride
Arise, o church arise!

Come, see the cross, where love and mercy meet,
As the Son of God is stricken;
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet,
For the Conqueror has risen!
And as the stone is rolled away,
And Christ emerges from the grave,
This victory march continues till the day
Ev'ry eye and heart shall see Him.

So Spirit, come, put strength in every stride;
Give grace for every hurdle.
That we may run with faith to win the prize
Of a servant good and faithful.
As saints of old, still line the way,
Retelling triumphs of His grace,
We hear their calls, and hunger for the day
When with Christ we stand in Glory.

CHORUS

244 HEAR THE CALL OF THE KINGDOM

Hear the call of the kingdom
Lift your eyes to the King
Let His song rise within you
As a fragrant offering
Of how God rich in mercy
Came in Christ to redeem
All who trust in His unfailing grace

Hear the call of the Kingdom
To be children of light
With the mercy of heaven
The humility of Christ
Walking justly before Him
Loving all that is right
That the life of Christ may shine through us

(Chorus)
King of Heaven we will answer the call
We will follow bringing hope to the world
Filled with passion, filled with power to proclaim
Salvation in Jesus' name

Hear the call of the Kingdom
To reach out to the lost
With the Father's compassion
In the wonder of the cross
Bringing peace and forgiveness
And a hope yet to come
Let the nations put their trust in Him

245 GOD OF EVERY GRACE

O let not this world of sorrows
Steal my only hope away
For the power of Your gospel
Shines within this jar of clay
In affliction You bring wisdom
That my comforts can displace
How my true and greatest treasure
Is in You the God of grace

Now to the God of every grace
Who counts my tears, who holds my days
I sing through sorrows, sing with faith
O praise the God of every grace

Weary with the weight I carry
Give me wings of faith to rise
For You know each grief that lingers
Through the watches of the night
Surely You have borne our sufferings
At the cross took up our pain
And You lead us on to glory
As we trust You, God of grace

Now to the God of every grace
Who counts my tears, who holds my days
I sing through sorrows, sing with faith
O praise the God of every grace

There's a dawning hope before us
That I know is soon to break
As I wait upon Your mercy
Which will swallow every ache
Cries of joy and songs of victory
When we enter heaven's gates
All Your children home together
All with You the God of grace

Now to the God of every grace
Who counts my tears, who holds my days
I sing through sorrows, sing with faith
O praise the God of every grace
Now to the God of every grace
Who counts my tears, who holds my days
I sing through sorrows, sing with faith
O praise the God of every grace
O praise the God of every grace
O praise the God of every grace

There's peace that outlasts darkness
Hope that's in the blood
There's future grace that's mine today
That Jesus Christ has won
So I can face tomorrow
For tomorrow's in Your hands
All I need You will provide

But I know what You've done
I'm fighting a battle that

There's mercy in the waiting
Mana for today
And when it's gone I know you're not
You are my hope and stay
When the sea is raging

He'll fix my eyes on Jesus Christ
And I'll say that is well
Oh I know that it is well

We will be with You again
You're my Savior my defense
No more fear in life or death
I know how this story ends

248 LET ALL MORTAL FLESH KEEP SILENCE (FEAT. JJ HELLER)

Let all mortal flesh keep silence
And with fear and trembling stand
Ponder nothing earthly-minded
For, with blessing in His hand
Christ our God to earth descendeth
Our full homage to demand

King of kings, yet born of Mary
As of old on earth He stood
Lord of lords, in human vesture
In the body and the blood
He will give to all the faithful
His own self for heav'nly food

Rank on rank the host of heaven
Spreads its vanguard on the way
As the Light of light descendeth
From the realms of endless day
That the pow'rs of hell may vanish
As the darkness clears away

At His feet the six-winged seraph
Cherubim with sleepless eye
Veil their faces to the Presence
As with ceaseless voice they cry
"Alleluia, alleluia
Alleluia, Lord Most High!
Alleluia, Lord Most High!"

 

John 1:4-5 (ESV):  In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

Consider all the works Thy hand hath made
I see the stars I hear the mighty thunder
Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed

And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur

Sent Him to die I scarce can take it in
That on the Cross my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin

And take me home what joy shall fill my heart
Then shall I bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim my God how great Thou art

When I survey the wondrous cross
on which the Prince of glory died,
my richest gain I count but loss,
and pour contempt on all my pride.

save in the death of Christ, my God!
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them through his blood.

Love so amazing, so divine,
demands my soul, my life, my all.

Before the throne of God above
I have a strong and perfect plea
A great High Priest whose name is love
Who ever lives and pleads for me
My name is graven on His hands
My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heav'n He stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart

VERSE 2
When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end to all my sin
Because the sinless Savior died
My sinful soul is counted free
For God the Just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me
To look on Him and pardon me

VERSE 3
Behold Him there, the risen Lamb
My perfect, spotless Righteousness
The great unchangeable I AM
The King of glory and of grace
One with Himself, I cannot die
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high
With Christ my Savior and my God
With Christ my Savior and my God

Verse
All sufficient merit shining like the sun
A fortune I inherit by no work I have done
My righteousness I forfeit at my Savior's cross

In love He condescended eternal now in time
A life without a blemish the Maker made to die
The law could never save us our lawlessness had won
Until the pure and spotless Lamb had finally come

No more debt I owe
Paid in full all sufficient
Merit now my own

Good works now all corrupted by the sinful host
I'm dressed in my Lord Jesus, a crimson robe made white
No more fear of judgment His righteousness is mine

The joy of my salvation shall be my final breath
When I stand accepted before the throne of God
I'll gaze upon my Jesus and thank Him for the cross
Yes I'll thank Him for the cross

Oh Your merit now my own
Oh Your merit now my own

266 THIS IS MY FATHER'S WORLD (FROM PIPPA AND THE SINGING TREE)

This is my Father's world,
And to my listening ears
All nature sings, and round me rings
The music of the spheres.
This is my Father's world:
I rest me in the thought
Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas--
His hand the wonders wrought.

This is my Father's world:
The birds their carols raise,
The morning light, the lily white,
Declare their Maker's praise.
This is my Father's world:
He shines in all that's fair;
In the rustling grass I hear Him pass,
He speaks to me everywhere.

This is my Father's world:
O let me ne'er forget
That though the wrong seems oft so strong,
God is the Ruler yet.
This is my Father's world:
The battle is not done
Jesus who died will be satisfied
And earth and heaven be one

This is my Father's world:
Why should my heart be sad?
The Lord is King: let the heavens ring!
God reigns; let earth be glad!

269 COME, LET US RETURN TO THE LORD

Come, Let Us Return to the Lord
Words and Music by Matt Boswell, Michael Cochren, Matt Papa

Vs 1
All we have like sheep gone astray
Each of us has turned our own way
But God laid all our wrongs, our sins
Upon the Sinless One, His only Son


Chorus
Come, let us return to the Lord
Come, now all His mercies remember
How wide His love that waits to welcome us
Oh, come, let us return to the Lord


Vs 2
All who feel the sting of your sin
Come and lift your eyes once again
How great a price was paid to save the souls of us
Who stray, yet still we stray


Come, let us return to the Lord
Come, now all His mercies remember
How wide His love that waits to welcome us
Oh, come, let us return to the Lord


Vs 3
God, we need Your merciful hand
Heal us from our pride, heal our land
As we turn from our ways, oh turn our hearts to You
In praise, endless praise


Come, let us return to the Lord
Come, now all His mercies remember
How wide His love that waits to welcome us
Oh, come let us return to the Lord


Come, let us return to the Lord
Come, now all His mercies remember
How wide His love, it waits to welcome us
Oh, come, let us return
Oh, come let us return to the Lord
Oh, come let us return to the Lord

270 THIS JESUS

This Jesus
Aaron Williams, Bryan Fowler, Dave Aubrey, David Leonard
StillCreek Songs

Who ever could compare to Jesus, 
The one who had no start and has no end 
In wisdom far beyond all measure 
He spoke and galaxies began
In love He chose to dwell among us 
Empty himself to take our humble frame
Before he laid the world's foundation
He knew he'd give his life away

Hail Him, exalt Him
This Jesus is the Christ, Him alone
Praise Him, adore Him
This Jesus is the Christ, Him alone

Where ever could I find redemption
But at the hallowed hill of Calvary
The crushing weight of sin upon him
The Lamb of God instead of me
His buried body clothed in darkness
The seed of heaven in the earth was laid
Yet silence broke when he awakened
Our hope came bursting from the grave

This ever will be my confession
For I believe that I will rise with him
The risen one who reigns in heaven
I know he'll surely come again
His kingdom will be everlasting
His fame and glory will outshine all things 
All hail the Victor of the ages
Honor and power to the king
Let earth and heaven join to sing

271 OH, WHAT HIGH AND HOLY PRIVILEGE

Oh, What High and Holy Privilege
Words and Music by Matt Boswell, Bryan Fowler, Keith Getty, Kristyn Getty, Matt Papa

Oh, what high and holy priv'lege
Once again to gather here
In the name of our Lord Jesus
As we see His Day draw near
May we join in joyful rev'rence 
With thanksgiving, faith and love
As He welcomes in His people
To the throne of grace above

Oh, what high and holy priv'lege
Voices raised in prayer and praise
Boldly bringing great petitions 
Gladly singing hymns of faith
May His grace at work among us
Cleanse and heal us from our sin
That our prayers may not be hindered
And our praises honor Him

Oh, what high and holy priv'lege
Hearing from the word of God
Heaven speaks in perfect wisdom
Earth responds and stands in awe
Do our hearts not burn within us
As we see God's promises
Find their final yes in Jesus
Leading us to righteousness!

Oh, what high and holy priv'lege
This communion that we share
With the Father, Son, and Spirit
And His people everywhere
As we go with God's great blessing
In the keeping of His grace
Go in peace to love and service
Till we join again in praise

As we go with God's great blessing
In the keeping of His grace
Go in peace to love and service
Till we join again in praise
Till we join again in praise
