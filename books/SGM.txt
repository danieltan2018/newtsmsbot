2 A CHRISTIAN'S DAILY PRAYER

VERSE 1
As morning dawns and day awakes,
To You I bring my need
O gracious God, my source of strength,
In You I live and breathe
Each hour is Yours by wisdom planned,
Each deed empowered by sovereign hands
Renew my spirit, help me stand;
Be glorified today

VERSE 2
As day unfolds, I seek Your will
In all of life's demands
And though the tempter tries me still,
I cling to Your commands
Let every effort of my life
Display the matchless worth of Christ
Make me a living sacrifice;
Be glorified today

VERSE 3
As sun gives way to darkest night
Your Spirit still is here
And though my strength fades like the light
New mercies will appear
I rest in You; abide with me
Until our trials and suffering
Give way to final victory
Be glorified, today; be glorified, I pray

3 A DEBTOR TO MERCY

VERSE 1
A debtor to mercy alone
Of covenant mercy I sing
I come with Your righteousness on
My humble offering to bring
The judgments of Your holy law
With me can have nothing to do
My Savior's obedience and blood
Hide all my transgressions
From view

VERSE 2
The work which Your goodness began
The arm of Your strength will complete
Your promise is yes and amen
And never was forfeited yet
The future or things that are now
No power below or above
Can make You Your purpose forego
Or sever my soul from Your love

VERSE 3
My name from the palms of Your hands
Eternity will not erase
Impressed on Your heart it remains
In marks of indelible grace
Yes I, to the end will endure
Until I bow down at Your throne
Forever and always secure
Forever and always secure
Forever and always secure
A debtor to mercy alone

There are those who give away
It seems the more they give, the more they gain
There are others who hold back
The more they try to keep, the more they lack
The more they lack

He offered up His Son so we might live
Jesus gave His precious blood
To wash us clean and bring us back to God

7 A MIGHTY FORTRESS IS OUR GOD

VERSE 1
A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing
Our Helper He, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing
For still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe
His craft and pow'r are great, and, armed with cruel hate
On earth is not his equal

VERSE 2
Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing
Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God's own choosing
Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is He
The Lord of hosts His name, from age to age the same
And He must win the battle

VERSE 3
And though this world with devils filled should threaten to undo us
We will not fear, for God hath willed His truth to triumph through us
The Prince of Darkness grim, we tremble not for him
His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure
One little word shall fell him

VERSE 4
That word above all earthly pow'rs, no thanks to them, abideth
The Spirit and the gifts are ours through Him who with us sideth
Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also
The body they may kill; God's truth abideth still
His kingdom is forever

"Abba, Father" now we cry

VERSE 2
Once as prodigals we wandered
Hating what was all our need
But Your grace o'er sin abounding
Rescued us from misery
You the prodigals have pardoned
Kissed us with Your love
Spread the feast and now You've called us
E'er to dwell with You above
E'er to dwell with You above

They now live who once were dead

"For my people to be glad"

Shout Your praise in Heav'n above
While in us they learn the wonders
Of Your wisdom, grace, and love

Be to God and to the Lamb!"

11 ALAS! AND DID MY SAVIOR BLEED? (KAUFLIN)

VERSE 1
Alas, and did my Savior bleed
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?
Was it for sins that I had done
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity, grace unknown
And love beyond degree

CHORUS
My God, why would You shed Your blood
So pure and undefiled
To make a sinful one like me
Your chosen, precious child?

VERSE 2
Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut His glories in
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man, the creature's, sin
Thus might I hide my blushing face
While His dear cross appears
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness
And melt my eyes to tears

12 ALAS! AND DID MY SAVIOR BLEED? (TRADITIONAL)

And love beyond degree!

VERSE 2 
Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut His glories in,
When Christ the mighty Maker died
For man the creature's sin.
Thus might I hide my blushing face
While His dear cross appears.
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness
And melt my eyes with tears.

VERSE 3 
But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe;
Here, Lord, I give myself away,
'Tis all that I can do.
Alas! and did my Savior bleed
And did my Sovereign die?
Amazing pity, grace unknown,
And love beyond degree!

13 ALIVE

VERSE 1 
My heart of stone was dead to You
Asleep within a world
That scorned its Maker
Until You breathed into my soul
And I woke up to You
My glorious Savior

Chosen before all time

14 ALL ABOUT JESUS

VERSE 1
Every word of Your Word is true
They were all breathed out by You
Your Spirit wrote through men
Like a pen in the hand of a God Who knew
That we would need to know
How much You love us so
You wrote it down for us forever, Oh

CHORUS
From Genesis to Revelation
There's one story of Your great salvation
It's all about Jesus
Oh, it's all about Jesus
Shoutin' out from every page
There's one Hero that'll save the day
It's all about Jesus
Oh, it's all about Jesus

VERSE 2
Every word of Your Word gives light
Like the sun that shines so bright
It leads us day by day
To the One, the Way, the Truth, the Life
And every time we read
You give us what we need
To grow in grace and know You better, Oh

RAP
It's all about Jesus, even from Eden, we read
The serpent would be crushed by a seed of Eve cause
All glory belongs to the Son
Every story pointing to the Holy One, like

When Abraham put Isaac on the altar
He pulled the knife, but God, he never falters
Faithful to His promise He would provide
A substitute ram for the sacrifice, now

He gave commandments so we could see
His holiness and our desperate need, then
There were so many temporary sacrifices
None of them were perfect, no, but Christ is

The prophets spoke and they were not liars
God would send His own Son, to be Messiah
Rescue, redeem, restore, reclaim
Every saint loves His holy name, cause

He died on the cross to take our place
The final substitute and eternal grace
Then He rose from the grave and up to the throne
Until He comes again, to gather His own!

15 ALL CREATURES OF OUR GOD AND KING

Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

16 ALL EARS

CHORUS
I wanna be all ears when Mom is speaking
All ears when Dad is teaching
There's a lot I don't know
And they've been around a whole lot of years
And have covered some ground
Their words will make me wise, so I'm all ears

VERSE 1

I'll be all ears
When my mouth is jumping at something to say
I'll be all ears
Even when it's hard for me to hear

I'll be all ears
When they teach me Jesus' loving ways

Two elbows, two knees, but I'm all ears
Two eyes, one stare, and a whole lot of hair
But I'm all ears
Tomorrow, today, at school and at play
I'll be all ears
I'll be slow to speak, and quick to hear
'Cause I wanna be all ears!

17 ALL GLORY BE FOREVER

VERSE 1   
We had turned from God to sin's disgrace
We chose the path to hell
Perfect law of God condemned our race
For all in Adam fell
But the righteousness of God appeared
And the world found hope again
For the Righteous One has come down to bear
All the curse of sin and death

CHORUS
Now to Him Who's seated on the throne
All glory be forever
Oh, the depths of wisdom, grace, and power
All glory be forever
All glory be forever

VERSE 2
Every bond of sin that held us fast
Is left in Jesus' grave
We've been freed from all that gripped our past
From Satan's rule and reign
We've been raised to life to breathe His grace
As captives now reclaimed
All our guilt is gone, all our strivings ceased
We're alive to seek His fame

VERSE 3
Now our future's fixed, our journey clear
God will not let us go
Every trial that tempts our hearts to fear
He'll use to give us hope
All creation groans as we await
What our eyes have longed to see
Every pain and evil we've long endured
Will be crushed by Christ our King

VERSE 1
I once was lost in darkest night
Yet thought I knew the way

And if You had not loved me first
I would refuse You still

But as I ran my hell-bound race
Indifferent to the cost
You looked upon my helpless state

Now all I know is grace

Amazing love! How can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

So free, so infinite His grace
Emptied Himself of all but love
And bled for Adam's helpless race

For O my God, it found out me!
Amazing love! How can it be,
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

VERSE 3
Long my imprisoned spirit lay,
Fast bound in sin and nature's night
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light
My chains fell off, my heart was free
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee
Amazing love! How can it be
That Thou, my God shouldst die for me?

VERSE 4
No condemnation now I dread
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine
Alive in Him, my living Head
And clothed in righteousness divine
Bold I approach the eternal throne
And claim the crown, through Christ my own
Amazing love! How can it be
That Thou my God, shouldst die for me?

36 ARISE, MY SOUL, ARISE

VERSE 1
Arise, my soul, arise; shake off thy guilty fears
The bleeding sacrifice in my behalf appears
Before the throne my surety stands
Before the throne my surety stands
My name is written on His hands

VERSE 2
Five bleeding wounds He bears, received on Calvary
They pour effectual prayers; they strongly plead for me
"Forgive him, oh forgive," they cry
"Forgive him, oh forgive," they cry
"Nor let that ransomed sinner die!"

The Father hears Him pray, His dear Anointed One
He cannot turn away the presence of His Son
His Spirit answers to the blood
His Spirit answers to the blood
And tells me I am born of God

My God is reconciled; His pardoning voice I hear
He owns me for His child; I can no longer fear
With confidence I now draw nigh
With confidence I now draw nigh
And "Father, Abba, Father" cry

38 AS LONG AS YOU ARE GLORIFIED

VERSE 1
Shall I take from Your hand Your blessings
Yet not welcome any pain?
Shall I thank You for days of sunshine
Yet grumble in days of rain?
Shall I love You in times of plenty
Then leave You in days of drought?
Shall I trust when I reap a harvest
But when winter winds blow, then doubt?

CHORUS
Oh let Your will be done in me
In Your love I will abide
Oh I long for nothing else as long
As You are glorified

VERSE 2
Are You good only when I prosper
And true only when I'm filled?
Are You King only when I'm carefree
And God only when I'm well?
You are good when I'm poor and needy

You still reign in the deepest valley
You're still God in the darkest night

Quiet my restless heart
Quiet my restless heart in You

To bring Him glory with your life

As you leave, may you feel His mighty hand
Guiding your steps in the race you run

My iniquity seems endless
Yet greater still Your grace

And we'll be glad when the Lord comes back
If we're trusting Him today

With all my heart
Because You first loved me

The way You do
I'll love them too

It always gives and gives
To God and then it lives
To help my neighbor

Stuck here I'm tied in knots
I need a Savior
Jesus, set me free to love You more than me

47 BEFORE THE CROSS

I place my trust in the Savior
Your finished work captures my gaze
You bore the wrath, I know the grace

A great High Priest whose name is love
Who ever lives and pleads for me

My name is written on His heart
I know that while in heav'n He stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart
No tongue can bid me thence depart

VERSE 2
When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within
Upward I look and see Him there

For God the Just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me
To look on Him and pardon me

Behold Him there, the risen Lamb
My perfect, spotless Righteousness

Better by far
That You work in my life
To the praise of Your glory and grace

Seal it for Thy courts above

Thy Word can bring a sweet relief
For every pain I feel.

But oh! When gloomy doubts prevail,
I fear to call Thee mine;
The springs of comfort seem to fail,

Yet, gracious God, where shall I flee?
Thou art my only trust;
And still my soul would cleave to Thee
Though prostrate in the dust.

VERSE 3
Hast Thou not bid me seek Thy face,
And shall I seek in vain?
And can the ear of sov'reign grace
Be deaf when I complain?

Attends the mourner's prayer;
O may I ever find access
To breathe my sorrows there.

Thy mercy seat is open still,
Here let my soul retreat;
With humble hope attend Thy will,
And wait beneath Thy feet.

From His kind and perfect ways
Making clear my desperate need

Give me grace Lord let me own

Scars which ever cry for me
Once condemned but now set free

Born to us in poverty

In You alone we hope and trust
Jesus, Savior, God with us
Emmanuel

We were blind and lost and godless
Wandering a trackless waste

Down from heaven came a Savior
Born a child, so small and frail
Taking up our pain and troubles
Conquering where we had failed

VERSE 3
You who with a word created
Sun and moon and seas and sand
Lay there sleeping in a manger
Cradled by Your mother's hand
You who made the mighty forests
Would lie down upon a tree
Fastened there with nails for sinners
Would bleed and die to set us free

Father, what love You've shown to rebels
That You would send Your Son so dear

To watch Your dear Son suffering

VERSE 3
Jesus, it fills our hearts with wonder
That You would leave Your heavenly place
To take on flesh to thirst and hunger
To save the ones who spurned Your grace

To die that mercy we would find

So in our hearts Your grace would shine

Never again to leave Your throne
Because of You we are befriended

107 GIVERS LIKE GOD

Based on Luke 12:22-34

VERSE 1
God chose to give the flowers petals
And knows to give the birds their feathers

He knows that birds like caterpillars (ew!)
God is the first and best of givers
He always knows and so we know

Clothes to wear, food to eat
Love to share, and air to breathe
God is full of generosity
And so we know we want to be
Givers like God, givers like God

A grateful heart will not be greedy
God gives us all we need so freely
So, when we see somebody needy
We want to share
If we've received the gift of heaven (yes!)
We have received the greatest blessing (blessed!)
O Spirit, help us learn this lesson:
The riches there can't be compared

Crave it and we covet
And that's not right
It's so much better to consider
The joy of being givers
Like Jesus Christ

That I was made to know
What else can I do?
Jesus, You're my all
I gladly run to You

For their troubles fill my life
Turn and seek my God and Savior
For His goodness satisfies
Earthly treasures, all are passing
Thieves break in and rust destroys
But in God are awesome splendor
Love, and everlasting joys

TAG
Gladly would I give to Jesus

Holding forth His wounded hands.

How low was our Redeemer brought, the Lord the worlds obeyed
Would stumble as He learned to walk upon the ground He'd made
The One the angels bowed before would kneel to wash our feet
And be at home among the poor though He owned everything

Chorus
Gloria, gloria in the highest
Gloria, gloria in the highest

Verse 3
How low was our Redeemer brought to raise us from our shame
And now the highest praise of all belongs to Jesus' name
The Healer wounded on a tree to bear our grief and sin
The King gave up His crown so we could ever reign with Him

183 HOW MAJESTIC

VERSE 1
When I see the stars in heaven
You have flung across the sky
What is man that You should love him
Or that he should catch Your eye
Yet You sent Your Son to die
That we might come to find
Our life in Him

CHORUS
O Lord, our Lord
How majestic is Your name
Majestic is Your name
In all the earth
O Lord, our Lord
How majestic is Your name
Majestic is Your name
In all the earth
In all the earth
In all the earth

VERSE 2
You are awesome in Your glory
We are sinful and impure
How can we approach the Holy
Who will not one sin endure
Yet You sent Your Son to die
His blood has paid the price
For all our sin

184 HOW RICH A TREASURE WE POSSESS

185 HOW SWEET AND AWEFUL IS THE PLACE

VERSE 1
How sweet and aweful is the place
With Christ within the doors
While everlasting love displays
The choicest of her stores

VERSE 2
While all our hearts and all our songs
Join to admire the feast
Each of us cry with thankful tongues
"Lord, why was I a guest?"

VERSE 3
"Why was I made to hear Thy voice
And enter while there's room
When thousands make a wretched choice
And rather starve than come?"

VERSE 4
'Twas the same love that spread the feast
That sweetly drew us in
Else we had still refused to taste
And perished in our sin

VERSE 5
Pity the nations, O our God
Constrain the earth to come
Send Thy victorious Word abroad
And bring the strangers home

VERSE 6
We long to see Thy churches full
That all the chosen race
May with one voice and heart and soul
Sing Thy redeeming grace

186 HOW SWEET THE DAY

VERSE 1
How sweet the day when Christ was born
When God Himself took human form
He came to wash our sins away
Our death to die, our debt to pay

VERSE 2
How sweet the day when Hope appeared
The One who frees us from our fears
He came to break the power of sin
And give us power to follow Him

CHORUS
Oh sing for joy, lift up your voice
Let us sing for joy, the whole earth rejoice
Let us sing for joy to the Son
For Jesus, our Savior, has come

VERSE 3
How sweet the day when Christ returns
We'll see the One for whom we yearn
Then we'll look full upon His face
Our hearts will burst with songs of praise

BRIDGE
Come, Lord Jesus, come

187 HOW VAST THE LOVE

VERSE 1
Come gaze upon your Savior
Behold your great High Priest
Draw near in awe and wonder
His cross has spoken peace

VERSE 2
Come rest from sin and striving
Find endless stores of grace
The heart that turns to Jesus
Is cleansed from every stain

CHORUS
Oh, how deep, how wide, how long
Oh, how vast the love of Jesus
Oh, how sure, how sweet, how strong
Oh, how vast His love for us

VERSE 3
So lift your eyes to Jesus
Arise from doubt and shame
His blood cries, 'It is finished!'
Our life is in His name

VERSE 4
What now can separate us?
Can death or pain or fear?
We have this strong assurance
In Christ we've been brought near
And in His strength we'll labor
His promises our hope
Thus far His love has led us!
His love will lead us home!

188 I ASKED THE LORD THAT I MIGHT GROW

VERSE 1
I asked the Lord that I might grow
In faith and love and ev'ry grace,
Might more of His salvation know,
And seek more earnestly His face.

VERSE 2
'Twas He who taught me thus to pray,
And He, I trust, has answered prayer,
But it has been in such a way
As almost drove me to despair.

VERSE 3
 I hoped that in some favored hour
At once He'd answer my request
And, by His love's constraining pow'r,
Subdue my sins and give me rest.

VERSE 4
Instead of this, He made me feel
The hidden evils of my heart
And let the angry pow'rs of hell
Assault my soul in ev'ry part.

VERSE 5
Yea, more with His own hand He seemed
Intent to aggravate my woe,
Crossed all the fair designs I schemed,
Humbled my heart and laid me low.

VERSE 6
"Lord, why is this," I trembling cried;
"Wilt Thou pursue Thy worm to death?"
"'Tis in this way," the Lord replied,
"I answer prayer for grace and faith."

VERSE 7
"These inward trials I employ
From self and pride to set thee free
And break thy schemes of earthly joy
That thou may'st find thy all in Me."

189 I BOW DOWN

VERSE 1
Around You such beauty
Your majesty could fill
An endless sky
Holy are You Lord
Transcendent exalted
The heavens cannot contain
Your presence
Holy are You Lord
And as I behold Your glory
I'm undone

CHORUS
I bow down at Your feet
I bow down at Your feet
I bow down at Your feet for
You are my God
My God

VERSE 2
You saved me the sinner
With crimson red You washed me
White as snow
How I love You Lord
You loved me the mocker
With kindness You won my
Heart forever
How I love You Lord
And as I behold this mercy
I'm undone

190 I COME BY THE BLOOD

VERSE 1
You are the perfect and righteous God
Whose presence bears no sin
You bid me come to Your holy place
How can I enter in
When Your presence bears no sin?
Through Him, who poured out His life for me
The atoning Lamb of God
Through Him, and His work alone
I boldly come

CHORUS
I come by the blood, I come by the cross
Where Your mercy flows
From hands pierced for me
For I dare not stand on my righteousness
My every hope rests on what Christ has done
And I come by the blood

VERSE 2
You are the high and exalted King
The One the angels fear
So far above me in every way
Lord, how can I draw near
To the One the angels fear?
Through Him who laid down His life for me
And ascended to Your side
Through Him, through Jesus alone
I boldly come

191 I COME RUNNING

VERSE 1
Jesus, I am blind, be my light
Darkened in my mind, be my wisdom
Bend my stubborn will to Your own
Open up my ears to hear Your Spirit
Melt my conscience once again
Help me hate the slightest sin
And when Satan comes to tempt me

CHORUS
I come running to You, when I fear, when I'm tried
I come running to You, to Your blood, to Your side
And there my soul finds rest
There my soul finds rest in You

VERSE 2
Shepherd of my soul, lead me on
To the pastures green in Your Scriptures
Make me to lie down by waters still
Fill me with Your peace in the tempest
I take my refuge in Your cross
By your sacrifice I'm washed
And when Satan comes accusing

VERSE 3
Once I was Your foe, a slave to sin
A stranger to Your love, a hopeless outcast
But You have brought me near, I'm bought with blood
Now I'm Your precious child, an heir with Jesus
You pour heaven into my soul
Your wondrous love, it overflows
And I marvel how You love me

192 I DON'T HAVE TO HIDE

VERSE 1
When I have done something
I know I shouldn't do
And I'm tempted to hide it
When I have spoken words
I know I shouldn't speak
And I want to deny it
If I confess my sins, I'll find mercy

CHORUS
Blessed is the one who fears the Lord
And admits his sin
Blessed is the one who trusts the Lord
Who alone forgives
Jesus died so I don't have to hide anymore

VERSE 2
When I have taken something
I know I shouldn't take
And I try to conceal it
When I have disobeyed
The rules my parents made
I shouldn't keep it a secret
If I confess my sins, I'll find mercy

BRIDGE
When we know we're forgiven
We don't have to be afraid
We'll want to run from sin
And follow Jesus every day

193 I GREET THEE, WHO MY SURE REDEEMER ART

VERSE 1
I greet Thee, who my sure Redeemer art,
My only Trust and Savior of my heart,
Who pain didst undergo for my poor sake;
I pray Thee, from our hearts all cares to take.

VERSE 2
Thou art the King of mercy and of grace,
Reigning omnipotent in every place;
So come, O King, and our whole being sway;
Shine on us with the light of Thy pure day.

VERSE 3
Thou art the life by which alone we live
And all our substance and our strength receive;
Sustain us by Thy faith and by Thy pow'r,
And give us strength in ev'ry trying hour.

VERSE 4
Our hope is in no other save in Thee;
Our faith is built upon Thy promise free;
Lord, give us peace and make us calm and sure,
That in Thy strength we evermore endure.

194 I HAVE A SHELTER

VERSE 1
I have a shelter in the storm
When troubles pour upon me
Though fears are rising like a flood
My soul can rest securely
O Jesus, I will hide in You
My place of peace and solace
No trial is deeper than Your love
That comforts all my sorrows

VERSE 2
I have a shelter in the storm
When all my sins accuse me
Though justice charges me with guilt
Your grace will not refuse me
O Jesus, I will hide in You
Who bore my condemnation
I find my refuge in Your wounds
For there I find salvation

VERSE 3
I have a shelter in the storm
When constant winds would break me
For in my weakness, I have learned
Your strength will not forsake me
O Jesus, I will hide in You
The One who bears my burdens
With faithful hands that cannot fail
You'll bring me home to heaven

195 I HEAR THE WORDS OF LOVE

VERSE 1
I hear the words of love,
I gaze upon the blood,
I see the mighty sacrifice,
And I have peace with God.

VERSE 2
'Tis everlasting peace!
Sure as Jehovah's Name;
'Tis stable as His steadfast throne,
Forevermore the same.

VERSE 3
The clouds may come and go
And storms may sweep my sky;
This blood-sealed friendship changes not;
The cross is ever nigh.

VERSE 4
My love is oft-times low,
My joy still ebbs and flows;
But peace with Him remains the same;
No change Jehovah knows.

VERSE 5
I change, He changes not,
The Christ can never die;
His love, not mine, the resting place,
His truth, not mine, the tie.

196 I LAY IT ALL

VERSE 1
When troubles come, when darkness crowds
When fortunes fail and loss surrounds
My soul is weak, but Christ is strong
And so to Him I leave it all
For He Who holds all things
Can bear each care I bring

CHORUS
So, I lay it all on Jesus
Steadfast is the love of Jesus
He hears my cry, He's faithful
I lay it all on Jesus

VERSE 2
When questions rise, when faith wears thin
When fears come fast, and truth grows dim
The One Who saved will not forsake
I'll trust His word and trust His way
For He Who bore my blame
Can bear each care I name

BRIDGE
I am weak; You are strong
Jesus, come and take it all
All my cares I cast on You

TAG
I lay it all, I lay it all on Jesus

197 I LOOK TO THE CROSS

VERSE 1
How do I know You love me
I look around and see
The sunshine the rain
And the wind in the trees
But should these gracious tokens
All fade from my sight
I won't doubt Your love
For I fix my eyes

CHORUS
I look to the Cross
Where I most clearly see
Your awesome love displayed for me
For even when I was dead in sin
You died for me
Oh I look to the Cross

VERSE 2
How do I know You love me
At times I'm so aware
I sense Your Holy Spirit
I see You everywhere
But when I leave the mountain
And Your face is hid from sight
I won't doubt Your love
For I fix my eyes

198 I LOOK UP

VERSE 1
When I look all around me
And all I can see
Are my mountains of failure and sin
I will hope in the One
Crucified in my place
Jesus Christ the Redeemer of men

CHORUS
I look up to the Cross
Where I see my Sin-Bearer
Hanging there in deepest agony
I look up to the Cross
Where Your cleansing blood flows
And I feel a great weight lift from me

VERSE 2
When I'm standing accused
And I'm guilty as charged
And I've nothing that I can defend
I will trust in the righteousness
Given to me
By Jesus my Savior and Friend

VERSE 3
When I measure my heart
By Your holy decrees
All my motives and deeds I despise
I will claim all Your sacrifice
Purchased for me
By Your death I will stand justified

199 I LOVE THE CROSS

VERSE 1
All my sins forgiven
Far removed as east from west
Cast into the depths of the ocean
Of grace and redeeming love

CHORUS
I love the place where my Savior died
I love the place where I was justified
I love the place
Where Your blood flowed down
To give me life
I love the Cross
I love the Cross
I love the Cross
The Cross of Christ

VERSE 2
All my guilt atoned for
Every debt is paid in full
Though my sins were scarlet
Now I'm clean as a fresh fallen snow

200 I MUST HAVE YOU

VERSE 1
I drink deep from
Your well of grace
And it's sweet so sweet to my soul
For none can quench
This thirsting of my heart
But You alone
Because You have made me to
Know and enjoy You forever
I cry to You

CHORUS
Lord I must have You
Your goodness Your truth
I am consumed
With passion for You
The one who has saved me
The one who sustains me
I'm desperate it's true
Lord I must have You

VERSE 2
I'm possessed with a hunger to
Behold Your majesty
And I'm obsessed with the wonder
That You my God
Would die for me
Because of the Cross
I will praise
I will love You forever
So I cry to You

BRIDGE
Do I need the air to breathe
Do I need for my heart to beat
Not as much as I need You

201 I STAND IN AWE

VERSE 1
You are beautiful beyond description
Too marvelous for words
Too wonderful for comprehension
Like nothing ever seen or heard
Who can grasp Your infinite wisdom?
Who can fathom the depth of Your love?
You are beautiful beyond description
Majesty, enthroned above

CHORUS
And I stand, I stand in awe of You
I stand, I stand in awe of You
Holy God, to whom all praise is due
I stand in awe of You

VERSE 2
You are beautiful beyond description
Yet God crushed You for my sin
In agony and deep affliction
Cut off that I might enter in
Who can grasp such tender compassion?
Who can fathom this mercy so free?
You are beautiful beyond description
Lamb of God who died for me

202 I SURRENDER ALL

CHORUS
I surrender all
I surrender all
All to You I surrender
I surrender all
I surrender all

Who laid down His life for my sin
He purchased my freedom
And made me an heir
Now I belong to Him

All to You I surrender
I surrender all

And made me an heir
Now I belong to Him

VERSE 1
How sweet the place where You dwell, O Lord
My soul longs and faints for You
My heart sings out a loud song of joy
For I have known the living God

CHORUS
I want to be where You are, O Lord
I want to be where You are, O Lord
I'd rather have just one day with You
Than be anywhere else

VERSE 1
There's no good thing that You will withhold
From those who live to follow You
I'd rather be Your servant, O God
Than have the riches of this world

BRIDGE
Those who follow You go from strength to strength
Those who trust in You are filled with joy
Those who follow You go from strength to strength
Those who trust in You are filled with joy

205 I WILL BOAST IN THE CROSS

VERSE 1
God did not call us
Because we were wise
Or gifted with riches and might
His chosen ones are
The weak in this world
Who hope in His all-saving name
That He might receive all the praise

CHORUS
So I will boast in the Cross of Christ
And I will glory in Jesus
And His sacrifice
I will boast in the Cross of Christ
It is the power
It is the wisdom of God
And my great ransom
The Cross of Christ

VERSE 2
Great is the mystery
Of God's sovereign ways
That flow from the depths of His grace
That He would give up
His one precious Son
To bear all the cost of my sin
Is a wonder I can't comprehend

206 I WILL CAST MY CARES

VERSE 1
Jesus, I'm frail, I'm so very weak
My faithfulness fails, my courage will flee
But You are my rock, my shelter and shade
When I'm burdened down, You'll carry the weight

CHORUS
So I will cast my cares on You
Yes, I will cast my cares on You
I will rest within Your arms
Knowing I am safe from harm
I will cast my cares on You

VERSE 2
When I'm overwhelmed and I cannot stand
You hear every cry and You lift my head
I'm desperate for grace and mercy anew
I must have Your strength, Oh I must have You

207 I WILL GLORY IN MY REDEEMER

VERSE 1
I will glory in my Redeemer
Whose priceless blood has ransomed me
Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails
And hung Him on that judgment tree
I will glory in my Redeemer
Who crushed the power of sin and death
My only Savior before the holy Judge
The Lamb who is my righteousness
The Lamb who is my righteousness

VERSE 2
I will glory in my Redeemer
My life He bought, my love He owns
I have no longings for another
I'm satisfied in Him alone
I will glory in my Redeemer
His faithfulness my standing place
Though foes are mighty and rush upon me
My feet are firm, held by His grace
My feet are firm, held by His grace

VERSE 3
I will glory in my Redeemer
Who carries me on eagles' wings
He crowns my life with lovingkindness
His triumph song I'll ever sing
I will glory in my Redeemer
Who waits for me at gates of gold
And when He calls me, it will be paradise
His face forever to behold
His face forever to behold

208 I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE ALONE

VERSE 1
I am not ashamed
Of the gospel of Your grace that saved me
You called me from the grave
And the power of Your Spirit raised me

PRE-CHORUS
Lord, You gave Your life for mine

CHORUS
I will sing Your praise alone
I will sing Your praise alone
You're worthy of my highest song
I will sing Your praise alone
I will sing Your praise alone
I will sing Your praise alone
You're seated on the highest throne
I will sing Your praise alone

VERSE 2
I have been redeemed
By the blood You shed to change my story
Your love has set me free
So that I can live to bring You glory

VAMP
Be glorified, I will praise you, I will praise you
With all my life, I will praise you, I will praise you

209 I'M CALLING OUT

VERSE 1
When this world is filled with change
And so much I can't explain
From the peaks of joy
To the valleys of pain
Your faithfulness remains
Your faithfulness remains

CHORUS
So I'm calling out
To You who called me
I'm holding on
To You who holds me
I'm seeking You who came and
Sought me in my sin
And You've been faithful
Again and again
So I'm calling out

VERSE 2
When my strength is dry and drained
And my hope begins to wane
You are always near
To lift me again
Your faithfulness remains
Your faithfulness remains

210 IMMOVABLE OUR HOPE REMAINS

VERSE 1
Immovable our hope remains
Though shifting sands before us lie
The One who washed away our stains
Shall bear us safely to the skies
The floods may rise, the winds may beat
Torrential rains descend
Yet God His own will not forget
He'll love and keep us till the end
You'll love and keep us till the end

VERSE 2
This is eternal life: to know
The living God and Christ, the Son
The Savior will not let us go
Until His saving work is done
Our debt was great, as was our need
But now the price is paid
Who can behold Immanuel bleed
And doubt His willingness to save?
We trust Your willingness to save

VERSE 3
The Lord acquits, who can condemn?
Though Satan's accusations fly
His pow'r can never reach our names
To blot them from the Book of Life
The Son has surely made us free
His Word forever stands
And all our joy is knowing we
Are graven on His wounded hands
We're graven on Your wounded hands

VERSE 4
Built into Christ, secure we stand
For with His Spirit we've been sealed
By grace we'll see the promised land
Where every sorrow shall be healed
To God who gave His only Son
To Jesus Christ, our Lord
To God the Spirit, Three-in-one
Be songs of praise forevermore
We'll sing Your praise forevermore

One that did not start with me

I will worship
I will honor
I will exalt the Lord above

VERSE 1
When You lead me to the valley of vision
I can see You in the heights

It's here Your glory shines so bright
So let me learn that the cross precedes the crown
To be low is to be high
That the valley's where You make me more like Christ

Let me find Your grace in the valley
Let me find Your life in my death
Let me find Your joy in my sorrow
Your wealth in my need
That You're near with every breath
In the valley

VERSE 2
In the daytime there are stars in the heavens
But they only shine at night

The more I see their radiant light
So let me learn that my losses are my gain
To be broken is to heal

In You is grace and perfect rest
Deliverance from all my shame

In You my heart
Has finally found its home
And You will be my dwelling place

In You alone is all delight
In You alone is all my gladness
In You alone my soul is satisfied
Satisfied in You alone

Has come back to its Shepherd
My wandering heart
By precious blood is healed

Our mighty Savior and our King
Great love of God in flesh revealed

VERSE 1
No majesty or beauty
He came to dwell with the lowly
Man of sorrows, despised, rejected
As one from whom men hide their faces
Despised and we esteemed Him not

CHORUS 1
Oh He has come, look upon the One
Jesus, Son of God, lifted up for us

He bore our griefs and afflictions
Pierced for our transgressions
We like sheep have gone astray
Each of us to his own way
His punishment has brought us peace

Oh He has come, look upon the One
Jesus, Son of God, lifted up for us
Oh see His love, Jesus, heaven's light
No longer to be despised
Glorious in our eyes

Assigned a grave with the wicked
Raised to life and seated glorious
Savior King, our God victorious
Never more to die, He lives

Oh see His love

218 ISN'T HE GOOD

VERSE 1
Your goodness
Found us in the darkness
Rescued us and freed us
Cleansed us from within
You saved us
Freely You forgave us
Counted us as righteous
And heirs with Your own Son

Isn't He good, isn't He kind
Hasn't He blessed us time after time
Isn't He good, all of our days
With endless mercies
And ceaseless grace
Oh let us sing: He is good

VERSE 2
Your mercies meet us
With the daybreak
And every breath that we take
Points us to Your grace
Your power
Keeps us till the hour
Every knee will bow and
Worship Christ alone

219 IT IS FINISHED

VERSE 1
You looked into the endless void
The wonder yet to be
And in the dark Your ageless voice
Spread out the galaxies
A sea of stars before Your eyes
Your glory filled the newborn skies
And You said, "It is good"
And the earth bears witness
It is finished.

VERSE 2
You looked into the crucible
That burned with agony
You humbly chose the Father's will
And climbed to Calvary
Your blood for all my sin, poured out
Your final breath that shook the ground
And You said, "It is done"
And Your scars bear witness
It is finished

VERSE 3
I look into the holy place
And through the open veil
I see my risen King of Grace
Who pleads my pardon still
My healing in Your sacrifice
My name within Your wounds inscribed
And You say, "You are mine"
And Your love bears witness
It is finished

VERSE 4
I'll look into eternity
When sorrow's seas have dried
I'll see the Lamb who died for me
In beauty glorified
With open arms You'll bring me home
To bow in worship at Your throne
And You'll say, "Come and rest"
As my heart bears witness
It is finished

220 IT IS NOT DEATH TO DIE

VERSE 1
It is not death to die
To leave this weary road
And join the saints who dwell on high
Who've found their home with God
It is not death to close
The eyes long dimmed by tears
And wake in joy before Your throne
Delivered from our fears

CHORUS
O Jesus, conquering the grave
Your precious blood has power to save
Those who trust in You
Will in Your mercy find
That it is not death to die

VERSE 2
It is not death to fling
Aside this earthly dust
And rise with strong and noble wing
To live among the just
It is not death to hear
The key unlock the door
That sets us free from mortal years
To praise You evermore

221 IT IS WELL WITH MY SOUL

VERSE 1
When peace like a river attendeth my way
When sorrows like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say
It is well, it is well with my soul

CHORUS
It is well with my soul
It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

VERSE 2
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come
Let this blest assurance control
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate
And has shed His own blood for my soul

My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought
My sin, not in part, but the whole
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul

The clouds be rolled back as a scroll
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend
Even so, it is well with my soul

222 IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME

VERSE 1
It should have been me Lord
To die on that Cross
Oh I should have suffered eternal loss
You should have been worshiped
Instead You were slain
But Lord by Your suffering I've received
Eternal gain

CHORUS
Lord of glory bruised and broken
Such a wonderful love
You've shown to me
In my darkness Your mercy found me
And I will thank You Lord
Through all eternity for saving me

VERSE 2
It should have been me Lord
When God hid His face
But You were cut off Lord in deep disgrace
You should have been honored
But You took my shame
To clothe me in Your own righteousness
That I might reign

223 IT WAS LOVE

VERSE 1
It was love that brought You from above
To walk upon the earth
And love that caused Your weariness
Your hunger and Your thirst
It was love that caused You to be tried
And tempted by the foe
And love that brought the nails and cross
And love that bought my soul

CHORUS
How wonderful Your love, the mystery of mysteries
Filling up my heart, more glorious than I know
How wonderful Your love
There's nothing else so sweet to me
I'll never be apart from the Lover of my soul
From the Lover of my soul

VERSE 2
Your love is filled with holiness
O Spirit, fan this flame
Your love will never cease or cool
Your love will never change
O let me see Your love for me
Around me everywhere
The shining sun, a gentle rain
Remind me of Your care

224 IT WAS YOUR GRACE

VERSE 1
It was Your grace that drew me to the cross
It was Your grace that gave me faith
It was Your grace that reconciled me to Yourself
Though I had sinned in every way
You disarmed me of everything that I would lean on
So I would lean on You
And You stripped me of everything I would depend on
So I'd depend on You

CHORUS
In You alone my strength is found
In You alone my hope abounds
In You alone my strength is found
My life is bound up in You

VERSE 2
And in my weakness give me still more grace
Grace to cast myself on You
In every trial let me find Your peace and joy
And grace to humbly walk with You
O disarm me of everything that I would lean on
So I will lean on You
Jesus, strip me of everything I would depend on
So I'll depend on You

Give me more grace
And new mercies every morning
Give me new mercies

It's all for You, Who died the death
That we deserve, it's all for You
All to bring You glory

All to bring You glory

Back to the cross we come again
Back to the mystery
Here where our Lord laid down His life
A ransom for you and me

Spoke of His suffering
But in defeat our victory came
Death has now lost its sting

Christ shed His blood
Sufficient for all
Who believe on the Son

Now at the cross we find our hope
Sure as Christ rose again
We know His work is fully done
Setting us free from sin

VERSE 4
Because of the cross we know our trials
One day will fade away
Drowned in the everlasting joy
Of seeing our Savior's face

227 IT'S YOUR GRACE

VERSE 1   
You will save whom You will save
We're the lost and helpless ones
The rebels and the renegades
Who spurned Your holy love
You will save whom You will save
Mercy will be magnified
Everyone has gone astray
And followed after lies
But You have loved us and opened our eyes

CHORUS
It's Your grace
From beginning to the end
It's Your grace
We will never comprehend
Why You drew the ones who ran from You
What can we do but offer You praise?

VERSE 2
You will save whom You will save
We were captive to our wills
And if our hearts had not been changed
We'd flee Your mercy still
You will save whom You will save
Who can question what You do?
You're the potter, we're the clay
You can make us as You choose
And there is no one who boasts before You

VERSE 3
You will save whom You will save
Yet the promised hope remains
You will rescue anyone
Who calls upon Your name
You will save whom You will save
Faithful love won't be denied
Christ has overcome the grave
And for our sins He died
And when He comes back His glory will shine

228 JESUS CAME TO EARTH

VERSE
Jesus came to earth
He lived a perfect life
He died upon the cross
Then He rose from the dead
Now He is in heaven
Seated on His throne
At the right hand of the Father
Where heaven is His home

CHORUS
We praise You Jesus, Son of God
We praise You Jesus, Son of Man
You left Your throne of grace
To suffer in our place
So we praise You, Jesus Christ

229 JESUS IS MINE

Took the sting of death away
Through His saving blood
Though my body fails and my flesh grows weak

My righteousness, my Great High Priest
Who intercedes for me before the throne

Nothing's concealed, all is revealed

Jesus, must rest in You

245 JUST THE WAY GOD WANTED US TO BE

So God gave him a helper, Eve
To carry out His plan

This happy husband and his wife
They showed the world what God is like
Until they disobeyed
And even though they lost it all
We still see fingerprints of God
In everyone He makes

He made us boys, He made us girls
Different pieces of the puzzle
Joined together perfectly
We are just the way God wanted us to be

But God Himself designed us all unique
So we could see
He wants each one to play a part
To show the world the Father's heart
To have a family

Yet You descended unto us

You conquered death and rose again

The Judge of all, faithful and true

For Your redeemed to see Your face

You can find him sleeping on his couch at home
When there's work outside for him to do

Never ever finishes the plans he's made
When you want his help around the house
You can try to find him but he's never around

Doesn't have a hope or a clue
When we work to please the Lord
God will make our plans secure

255 LISTEN UP!

Based on Matthew 13:1-23

VERSE 1
Here's a story 'bout a man I know
He set out with seed to sow
Some seed fell on the path that day
The birds swooped down and took it away

VERSE 2
Some seed fell on the rocks and stones
Shot up quick, but found no home
Other seeds fell on the thorny ground
The weeds came up and choked them out

Listen up! Then think about everything we've heard
Listen up! Our hearts are soil where the Word can grow
Holy Spirit, help us know how to listen up

The roots grew deep just like they should

Who believe in Him

Sons of disgrace are righteous made

257 LORD, HELP US FORGIVE

Based on Matthew 18:21-35 and Luke 7:41-50

VERSE 1
A king once had a servant
Who owed him a huge debt
But the king forgave the servant
Sent him home, and yet
When a friend who owed the servant
A debt that was so small
He begged the servant for mercy
But he got none at all
The king heard all about it
And was he ever mad!
He sent the servant to prison
And took away all he had
Said he had to stay there
Till he could pay it all back
'Cause the servant was forgiven
But forgiveness was what he lacked

CHORUS
Our debt was satisfied
On the cross when Jesus died
And if we've been forgiven
It's gotta change the way we're livin'
How can we hold a grudge
How can we fail to love
Once we have known what mercy is?
Lord, help us forgive

VERSE 2
Now, Peter came to Jesus
Because he was so confused
"If my brother keeps on sinning
Against me what should I do?
I'm trying to be patient
I'm trying to be kind
Do I have to forgive him
The same thing seven times?"
Our sins were countless
Like the sand on the shore
We should be grateful that the Lord
He's not keeping a score
No--His love erased them
They washed away when
He hung and died on the cross
And paid the payment

BRIDGE
It can be hard to forgive
There's no pretending
But we've been changed by a grace
That's never ending

258 LORD, YOU ARE GRACIOUS

VERSE 1
You do not treat us
As our sins deserve
Though we are guilty as charged
Your Son was treated
As if responsible for all my sin

CHORUS
Lord, You are gracious
Lord, You are compassionate
Slow to anger, rich in love
Lord, You are

VERSE 2
Your Son was perfect
Blamelessness itself
Father, You turned Your face away
You bruised and crushed Him
That I might know Your grace
For all my days

BRIDGE
The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases
His mercies never come to an end
The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases
His mercies never come to an end

259 LOST IS FOUND

Based on Luke 15

VERSE 1
There were a hundred sheep in fields of green
And their shepherd loved them so
But one got lost inside a deep ravine
And didn't know how to get home
The shepherd sought the one who strayed
And wouldn't rest 'til he could say:

CHORUS
"What once was lost is found
Raise up a joyful sound
Come now and celebrate
This one is home and safe!
What once was lost is found
It's time to jump around
Let happiness abound
For the lost is found!"

VERSE 2
There were ten precious coins a lady kept
Until one day there were nine
She ran around the house and carefully swept
To seek the one she couldn't find
And when at last her coin appeared
She wanted everyone to hear:

VERSE 3
There was a boy who left his father's home
But found himself with pigs and mud
He came back sure that he had been disowned
Though he was sad for what he'd done
But as in shame he hung his head
His father ran to him and said:

BRIDGE
Everyday it's happening--
The lost are found
By their loving King and
As they turn from all their sin
Listen, you can hear the angels sing:

260 LOVE LIKE YOU

Based on Luke 10:25-37

VERSE 1
A man travelin' down the road
Was robbed and left for dead
Some neighbors might have helped
But they walked on instead
And then a stranger came along
And bandaged up his wounds
And showed us what it means
To love like You

CHORUS
Lord, we wanna love like You
With open arms and an open heart
We wanna love like You
And show the world how good You are
Anyone can be our neighbor in need
Help us to do what You would do
We wanna love like You

VERSE 2
We were made for loving You
'Cause You're the very best
And to love our neighbors too
Treat them with kindness
And it's not okay to look away
And think we've done enough
'Cause that is not the way
That You love us

BRIDGE
When we were in desperate need
You loved us, loved us
While we were still Your enemies
You loved us, loved us
When there was nothing we could do
You loved us, loved us
So we could be like You, You loved us

There is no one like You

262 MAKE ME FAITHFUL

VERSE 1 
Jesus, You came a servant
To do Your Father's will
Through Satan's worst temptations
You were obedient still
You are the Rock of Ages

Though I grow weak and weary
You will make me stand

CHORUS 
I want to be like You are
I want to be faithful
Help me to be like You are
Oh make me faithful

VERSE 2 
I too must be a servant
Today and all my days
To use the gifts You've given
To bring You joy and praise
Though I am sure to fail You
You are so faithful
And though I stumble
You will pick me up again

BRIDGE 
Jesus, You're my faithful friend
You will help me till the end

263 MAKE ME WISE

VERSE 1
Solomon was a young man
When he learned that he'd be king
He feared the Lord like his father
So God said, "Ask for anything"

VERSE 2
He didn't ask for superpowers (no, he didn't)
Or to be a millionaire
He only asked God for one thing (yes, he did)
And gladly God heard his prayer

CHORUS
Make me wise, make me wise
Let me see through this world's lies
There are so many paths to follow
And I don't want to compromise
Make me wise, make me wise
So I'm pleasing in Your sight
Lord, I want to bring You glory
So I'm asking You to make me wise

VERSE 3
God is ready to help us (yes, He is)
When we call upon His name
He gives His grace to the humble (yes, He does)
Who, just like Solomon, pray

264 MERCIES ANEW

Every morning that breaks
There are mercies anew
Every breath that I take
Is your faithfulness proved
And at the end of each day
When my labors are through
I will sing of Your mercies anew

VERSE 2
When I've fallen and strayed
There were mercies anew
For you sought me in love
And my heart you pursued
In the face of my sin
Lord, You never withdrew
So I sing of Your mercies anew

CHORUS
And Your mercies, they will never end
For ten thousand years they'll remain
And when this world's beauty has passed away
Your mercies will be unchanged

VERSE 3
And when the storms swirl and rage
There are mercies anew
In affliction and pain
You will carry me through
And at the end of my days
When Your throne fills my view
I will sing of Your mercies anew
I will sing of Your mercies anew

265 MIGHTY FORTRESS

VERSE 1
A mighty fortress is our God
A shield that never fails
Amid the flood of mortal ills
His power will prevail
Our ancient foe is cruel and armed with hate
Yet with one word he'll bow to Jesus' reign

CHORUS
Hope in God, O my soul
He is strong and He is strong to save
Hope in God
He's a rock and your hiding place
He's a mighty fortress

We dare not trust in our own hand
Or all would be in vain
Our confidence is in the One
Who holds the worlds in place
He fights for us, the sovereign Lord of hosts
From age to age the triumph's His alone

266 MIGHTY MIGHTY SAVIOR

VERSE 1
No one is good
No one is holy before God

No one is pure
No one is righteous in Your sight
I need someone to save me

For helpless sinners like me

What a mighty, mighty Savior You are
What a mighty, mighty Savior You are
You can wash away my sin
You can change my heart within
What a mighty, mighty Savior You are

Sin is too strong
For me to conquer on my own

I cannot change my evil heart
I need someone to save me
But I'm so glad You died and rose again
For helpless sinners like me

267 MORE THAN LIFE ITSELF

VERSE 1
My soul finds rest in You alone
You are the God who knows my ways
Your sovereignty is so sweet to me
In Your hands are all my days

More than life itself
My God how I need You
My precious all in all
More than life itself
Oh Lord how I love You and
Long to be with You
More than life itself

You are my fountain of delights
The mention of Your matchless name
Causes my heart to soar on high

268 MY GLORIOUS HOPE

VERSE 1

And pour in like a flood
My soul will not despair
Within Your sovereign arms
No valley is too dark
To keep me from Your care

Ever faithful to Your own
You have filled my nights
With Your sweet song of grace
Jesus You're my glorious hope

When failures fill my eyes
Remind me once again
That my sufficiency
Is found upon the tree
That bought my righteousness
The depth of Your unchanging love
Displayed on Calvary

You are worthy of all the trust I place in You
My glorious hope
You're my glorious hope
You're my glorious hope

VERSE 1
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name

CHORUS
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

VERSE 2
When darkness hides His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

VERSE 3
His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

VERSE 4
When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne

271 MY LIFE IS AN OFFERING

VERSE 1   
This life is an altar
Where I want to offer
My soul, and my mind, and strength
Cleansed by Your mercy to live a life worthy
Of the One Who called my name

Jesus, be glorified
Jesus, be magnified
Let me be a pleasing sacrifice
Jesus, be glorified
Jesus, be magnified
Here on the altar
My life is an offering

Raised me up from death to life

And find it in You

272 MY REDEEMER'S LOVE

VERSE 1
My Redeemer's love is deeper
Than the depths of sin and hell
He who was enthroned in glory
Came to bring us to Himself
My Redeemer's love is wider
Than the breach my sins had made
He reached down into my darkness
He alone has pow'r to save

CHORUS 1
Deeper than the rolling seas
Higher than the mountain peaks
Your love is all I need

VERSE 2
My Redeemer's love is stronger
Than my fiercest enemies
He will hold me in the tempest
Through the flood He carries me
My Redeemer's love will lead me
Through the deepest valley here
He will shepherd me and guide me

Higher than the mountain peaks
Your love is all I need
Stronger than the rushing wind
Shattering the power of sin
Your love is all I need

As eternity draws near
I'll enjoy His love forever
At His throne for endless years
My Redeemer's love will fill me
On the day I see His face
I will love Him back forever
And forever sing His praise

273 MY SONG IS LOVE UNKNOWN

VERSE 1
My song is love unknown, my Savior's love to me
Love to the loveless shown, that they might lovely be
Oh who am I that for my sake
My Lord should take frail flesh and die?

VERSE 2
He came from His blest throne salvation to bestow
But men made strange, and none the longed for Christ would know
But oh my Friend, my Friend indeed
Who at my need His life did spend

VERSE 3
Sometimes they strew His way, and His sweet praises sing
Resounding all the day, hosannas to their King
Then "Crucify!" is all their breath
And for His death they thirst and cry

VERSE 4
Why, what hath my Lord done? What makes this rage and spite?
He made the lame to run, He gave the blind their sight
Sweet injuries! Yet they at these
Themselves displease, and 'gainst Him rise

VERSE 5
They rise and needs will have my dear Lord made away
A murderer they save; the Prince of Life they slay
Yet cheerful He to suffering goes
That He His foes from thence might free

VERSE 6
In life no house, no home, my Lord on earth might have
In death no friendly tomb but what a stranger gave
What may I say? Heav'n was His home
But mine the tomb wherein He lay

VERSE 7
Here might I stay and sing; no story so divine
Never was love, dear King! never was grief like Thine
This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise
I all my days could gladly spend

274 NAME ABOVE ALL NAMES

VERSE 1
From the brightness of His glory
Jesus, the Son of God, descends
Takes on the nature of a servant
Jesus, obedient to death
The Father willed to crush Him
As a sacrifice for sin
He satisfied God's justice
And in victory rose again

CHORUS
You are highly exalted
Name above all names
Worthy of all praise
You are reigning in glory
Jesus, You're the King
Over everything
Exalted to the highest place
Given the Name above all other names

VERSE 2
The tomb is empty Christ has risen
Jesus, the Lamb once crucified
The angels never cease to worship
Jesus, in heaven glorified
To Him belongs the power
The wisdom, might, and strength
All glory and dominion
To the Lord of every age

BRIDGE
Our knees will bow
Our tongues proclaim
That You are Lord of all

To lift You up in adoration
Living stones You're building together
One people for Your praise

277 NOTHING BETTER THAN JESUS

CHORUS
There's nothing better than Jesus
How happy are the ones who belong to You
There's nothing better than Jesus
The One who is the life and the only truth
And when You come, You fill our lives with fruit
There's nothing better than You

VERSE 1
What a beautiful world You've made for us
Filled with wonderful gifts that show Your love
The mountains and the valleys
The planets and the stars
But none of these can compare with who You are

VERSE 2
What a beautiful thing You've done for us
Came to die for our sins upon the cross
You love the weak and humble
Who run to You for help
You have the power to save like no one else

Planets and oceans, towering trees
Jesus is greater than all of these
Armies and airplanes, princes and kings
Jesus is stronger than everything
Presents and birthdays, Jesus is better
Forever and always, Jesus is better
Better than anything that you can imagine
Jesus is better than all

278 NOTHING IN ALL THE EARTH

VERSE 1   
What shall separate us from Your love?
Can years of sorrow break eternal bonds?
Can condemnation ever raise its voice
Against the pardon of the blood of Christ?
Though our journey here is long
This will be our triumph song

CHORUS
Nothing in all the earth
Not any height above
Could ever tear us from Your everlasting love
Nothing in all the earth
Not any height above
Could ever tear us from Your everlasting love

For now the sting of death is overcome
And all the powers of this world must fall
Before Your feet because You rule them all
And though our journey here is long
This shall be our triumph song

Nothing in all the earth
Could ever tear us from
Your everlasting love

279 NOTHING THAT MY HANDS CAN DO

VERSE 1
There's nothing that my hands can do
To save my guilty soul
I cannot cleanse my filthy stains
Or make my spirit whole
For nothing but the blood of Christ
Can all my sins erase
I dare not claim my righteousness
But hide within His grace
'Tis Christ who saved me from the depths
God's pardon I've received
I'm washed within His precious blood
My heart is sprinkled clean

VERSE 2
I'll praise the God of holiness
Of justice, truth, and might
Who guides me by His mighty hand
To walk within His light
While Satan weaves his shallow lies
God speaks to me in love
Reminding me His only Son
Has bought me with His blood
And Christ dispels my every doubt
Through Him I am redeemed
I love because He loved me first
I live because He lives

VERSE 3
My life is but a fleeting sigh
A tear within the sea
But You are everlasting, Lord
And You've predestined me
To leave this fading world behind
Not fearing death will come
For then I'll look on Jesus Christ
And to His arms I'll run
And when I see Him face to face
What glory that will be
To look upon my Savior's scars
And know they were for me

280 NOW WHY THIS FEAR

VERSE 1
Now why this fear and unbelief?
Has not the Father put to grief
His spotless Son for us?
And will the righteous Judge of men
Condemn me for that debt of sin
Now canceled at the cross?

CHORUS
Jesus, all my trust is in Your blood
Jesus, You've rescued us
Through Your great love

VERSE 2
Complete atonement You have made
And by Your death have fully paid
The debt Your people owed
No wrath remains for us to face
We're sheltered by Your saving grace
And sprinkled with Your blood

BRIDGE
How sweet the sound of saving grace
How sweet the sound of saving grace
Christ died for me

VERSE 3
Be still my soul and know this peace
The merits of your great high priest
Have bought your liberty
Rely then on His precious blood
Don't fear your banishment from God
Since Jesus sets you free

281 NUGGETS OF GOLD

CHORUS
Your Word's got nuggets of gold
A treasure for my soul
Getting them out is my goal
I'm gonna dig in, dig in, dig in
Like I'm diggin' for gold

VERSE 1
I'll go exploring like a treasure hunter
Diggin' down deep in a mine
And Your Spirit's gonna help me discover
What I need to find

VERSE 2
I'm gonna learn about the lazy sluggard
And to keep away from the fool
I will see that pleasing God is much better
Than tryin' to be cool

BRIDGE

Your Word's got nuggets, nuggets of gold
Your Word's got nuggets, nuggets of gold
Your Word's got nuggets, nuggets of gold

Jesus! the name that charms our fears
That bids our sorrows cease

His blood can make the foulest clean
His blood availed for me

VERSE 5
He speaks, and listening to His voice
New life the dead receive
The mournful, broken hearts rejoice
The humble poor believe

VERSE 1
O holy night, the stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of the dear Savior's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born!

VERSE 2
Humbly He lay, Creator come as creature,
Born on the floor of a hay-scattered stall.
True Son of God, yet bearing human feature,
He entered earth to reverse Adam's fall.
In towering grace, He laid aside His glory,
And in our place, was sacrificed for sin.
Fall on your knees! O hear the gospel story!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born!

VERSE 3
Come then to Him Who lies within the manger,
With joyful shepherds, proclaim Him as Lord.
Let not the Promised Son remain a stranger;
In reverent worship, make Christ your Adored.

With grace and peace, their lives He will adorn.
Fall on your knees! Receive the Gift of heaven!
O night divine, O night when Christ was born
O night, O holy night when Christ was born

My highest good and my unending need

O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer
Strong defender of my weary heart
My sword to fight the cruel deceiver

My song when enemies surround me
My hope when tides of sorrow rise
My joy when trials are abounding
Your faithfulness, my refuge in the night

VERSE 3
O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer
Gracious Savior of my ruined life
My guilt and cross laid on Your shoulders

May all my days bring glory to Your Name

Before the throne my surety stands
My name is written on His hands

For me to intercede
His all redeeming love
His precious blood to plead
His blood atoned for every race

Behold the risen Christ
Your Great High Priest
Your spotless sacrifice

"Don't let that ransomed sinner die!"

My God is reconciled
His pard'ning voice I hear

I can no longer fear
With confidence I now draw nigh
With confidence I now draw nigh
And "Father, Abba, Father," cry

Pleading now before the throne

Oh what a day, what a glorious day
When You conquered death
And rose up from the grave
What a day
What a day

VERSE 2
See the empty tomb, see the grave clothes there
He has left this place, you won't find Him here
All our fears have fled, let our hopes arise
Heaven waits for us, we will never die

BRIDGE
There is still a day that we're awaiting
When the glorious One we love appears
He will take us home with Him forever
He will finally wipe away our tears

296 ONCE UPON

Verse 1
Once upon a midnight clear
Heaven's song broke through the air
Peace and goodwill toward men
Born now in Bethlehem

Verse 2
Once upon a bed of straw
Slept the Sovereign Son of God
Lord of the universe
Breathing the dust of earth

Chorus
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, our Messiah
Name above every name, gloria in the highest

Verse 3
Once upon a splintered cross
Jesus died to rescue us
All of our shame and sin
Nailed to the tree with Him

Verse 4
Once upon a brilliant day
Christ the Conqueror was raised
Heaven and nature sing
"Praise to the King of kings!"

297 ONE STEP AT A TIME

VERSE 1
It seems like it was just yesterday
We had to say we were sorry
And even though we don't want to sin
We fall again every day
It feels like we're pushing a rock that won't move
We want to obey, but it's so hard to do
But if Jesus is Lord, we can be sure
Sin's not in charge anymore

CHORUS
And God's love will lead us
One step at a time as we walk in the light
He's faithful to keep us
One step at a time
As He's making us more like Christ

VERSE 2
Sin, it camps like an enemy
That's hidden deep down inside us
So, every day we still have to fight
To do what's right, good, and true
But when we grow tired and want to give in
God gives us power to say "No" to sin
He changes our lives and opens our eyes
So we can bring glory to Christ

298 ONE STILL NIGHT

VERSE 1
One still night, Mary awoke
Stirred by an angel, she trembled as he spoke
One small child would soon be born
The King of kings will wear a crown of thorns

CHORUS
"Glory to God," the angels sang
"Immanuel was born for you this day
Peace on earth, good will toward men
Immanuel has come to Bethlehem
Immanuel has come to Bethlehem"

VERSE 2
One still night, while Joseph dreamed
He saw a vision within his troubled sleep
One small child, his bride would give
Deliverer delivered to save us from our sin

BRIDGE
And to His kingdom there'll be no end
And to His kingdom there'll be no end
And to His kingdom there'll be no end

VERSE 3
One still night, a light was shown
That all the darkness could never overcome

299 ONE THING

VERSE 1
Jesus, You came to the earth
Dying the death I deserved
Freed me to love and to serve for Your glory
You pulled me out of the flames
Covered my guilt and my shame
Gave me a hope and a name for Your glory
So whatever I do, one thing I pursue

CHORUS
I want to please You, O God, all of my days
Your mercy has dawned and now I can see
I want to please You, O God, in all of my ways
No matter the cost I want to please You

VERSE 2
Whether I'm honored or cursed
Seen as the last or the first
You'll give me faith to endure for Your glory
Let me be broken or blessed
Use me in life or in death
I want to spend every breath for Your glory
So whatever I do, one thing I pursue

BRIDGE
You bought me, You own me, the love You have shown me
Has captured my heart and devotion
My life has been paid for, I know I was made for
This one thing, this one thing

300 ONLY IN THE CROSS

VERSE 1
When I look upon the cross
In that spectacle of suffering
I see the power of God
There the Son of God was crushed
And lifted up to die for me
And conquered death forever

CHORUS
So I will glory only in the cross
Yes, I will glory only in the cross
And I will make my boast
In the Lord Jesus Christ
Crucified to ransom us

VERSE 2
When I look upon the cross
In what might seem a senseless death
I see the wisdom of God
For there the sinless Holy One
Was made to be sin for me
Then He declared me righteous

301 ONLY JESUS

VERSE 1
Father of grace, You've sacrificed
Your only Son for us, the crucified Jesus
Enlarge our hearts to love Your Son

To make Him our great delight
Bringing worship with our lives

Only Jesus! Only Jesus!
Give us Jesus, we cry
Only Jesus! Only Jesus!
The Pearl of greatest price

VERSE 2
Spirit of grace, You've shed Your light
Upon our darkened eyes, unveiling Jesus Christ
Come change our hearts, conform our ways
To honor Jesus' Name, His glory our refrain
Let His love compel our own
As we worship at His throne

Jesus, our great Savior,
Lord of heaven, Son of God

302 ONLY YOU FOR ME

VERSE 1
When the cares of life
Come and darken my eyes
There's only You for me
When my heart grows cold
You bring fire to my soul
There's only You for me
You're all I desire
Lord You're all I need

CHORUS
I want only You for me
No other God will I ever seek
I want only You for me
Through all of eternity
There'll be only You for me

VERSE 2
When the way is hard
And the valley dark
There's only You for me
In my deepest loss
I will cling to the Cross
There's only You for me
In love's Sovereign hand
Is all I could need

VERSE 3
As I run the race
I will hope in Your grace
There's only You for me
When my flesh has failed
And I step through the veil
There's only You for me
And I'll fully know
That You're all I need

303 OUR GOOD FATHER

Based on Luke 11:1-13

VERSE 1
Lil' Johnny came home from school
Hungry, tired, needin' some fuel
Went to find some fish sticks in the fridge
Johnny's dad was standing there, said
"Sit on down, son, and I'll prepare"
You'll never guess what that dad did!
Whoa, whoa, what's the deal?
He served up the weirdest meal--
Sliding on his dinner plate
Johnny saw a rattlesnake!

CHORUS
No good father's gonna give us something like that
Uh-uh, no way
Our good Father always does us good
When we ask, but you gotta pray

VERSE 2
Lil' Suzy woke up one day
Hungerin', hankerin' for some eggs
When in the room her dad appeared
Then he gave her something strange
It didn't help her hunger pangs
In fact, her brown eyes filled with tears
Hey hey, my oh my, what'd she see? Why'd she cry?
Breakfast made her want to run--It was a scorpion!

OUTRO
Keep askin', keep hopin'
Keep knockin', it'll open
Keep prayin', keep seekin'
God knows just what we're needin'

When all our tears are washed away

Our hope is alive
Alive in Him, the Son is risen
Rejoice!
One day we'll arise
From death to life, our hope is alive in Christ

VERSE 2

Nor found in the praises of men
Our will to survive won't bring us new life
We look past this world to the next
Coming on the clouds
We'll see the King and all will bow

For we can trust
Your promises are true

Oh God of power, living Word

Poured mercy on our souls
And promised grace would come to save
To loose death's iron hold

CHORUS 1
You are our song from age to age
Our voices unite to recount Your praise
Again and again

VERSE 2

To finally see Your face

For all eternity

309 OUT OF THE DEPTHS

VERSE 1
Out of the depths, O Lord, I cry to You
When I am tempted to despair
Though I might fail to trust Your promises
You never fail to hear my prayer
And if You judged my sin
I'd never stand again
But I see mercy in Your hands

CHORUS
So more than watchmen for the morning
I will wait for You, my God
When my fears come with no warning
In Your Word I'll put my trust
When the harvest time is over and I still see no fruit
I will wait, I will wait for You

And does things I don't like
I hear Your gentle voice
Saying I have a choice
To make an enemy
Or to spread Your peace

A kingly ransom paid
When You, my Lord, were slain
Love unrivaled here displayed
Calls my heart to praise
The perfect Lamb of God

VERSE 1
The light of day was cloaked by night
And heaven closed its eyes
Wrath unspared for countless sins
The guiltless crucified
Hands of kindness driven through
Back on splintered beam
The holy curtain torn in two
Atonement made for me

VERSE 2
Insults mock the Son of God
The angels are restrained
But all the cup must be endured
For sinners to be saved
Can grace prevail in such a day
Of scandal and of scorn?
But with a cry "Forgive" You claim
Traitors as Your own

As You drew Your final breath
My debt was satisfied
And love divine in glorious might
Would vanquish death and rise

Till suns shall rise and set no more

Hear Him knock, don't say there's no room in the inn

319 PREPARED A PLACE FOR ME

VERSE 1
Mystery of mysteries
That God would make for me
A place within His family, though once His enemy
The Judge of every sinner sent Christ to Calvary
To prepare a place for me

VERSE 2
Judgment should be given
For this guilt upon my head
But the Father of all glory crushed His Son instead
Now I've been adopted, for God made this to be
You prepared a place for me

CHORUS
Blessed be, blessed be
My God and Savior, You've shown me favor
And prepared a place for me

Father, in the moment
When Your Son shall split the skies
And myriads of angels acclaim Him with their cries
By grace I will be able to join the jubilee
You prepared a place for me

320 READY, SET, GO!

Based on Matthew 13:44-46

Something more valuable than anything
We'd figure out a way to buy that land

Worth more than any other in the world
We might sell all we had and buy a boat

From Thy wounded side which flowed
Be of sin the double cure
Save from wrath and make me pure

Simply to Thy cross I cling
Naked come to Thee for dress
Helpless, look to Thee for grace
To Thy fountain, Lord, I fly

When my eyes shall close in death
When I soar to worlds unknown

327 SAND PILE BLUES

Based on Matthew 7:24-27

VERSE 1
Let me tell you 'bout the saddest news
It's the reason that I'm singin' the blues
I built myself a house on some seaside land
Along came a storm and it got out of hand
I heard a sound, my house fell down!
Now all I got is a pile of sand

CHORUS
I got the blues, the sand pile blues
That's all that's left from my foolishness
I didn't dig deep, my foundation was weak
So here's the key: don't be like me
Or you'll be singin' the sand pile blues

VERSE 2
I shoulda known what was up ahead
My next door neighbor came to me and said,
"Hey there, friend, you better make a plan
To build your house on a rock if you can
And when the winds come rushin' in
You won't be stuck with a pile of sand."

VERSE 3
So, here's the lesson from the things I've been taught:
You have to build your life on the solid Rock
Believe in Jesus that He died for your sins
And saved your life so you could follow Him
He'll make you stand and in the end
You won't be sittin' in a pile of sand

328 SEE HE COMES

VERSE 1
See, He comes upon the clouds
Jesus Christ, our King appears
All the saints bought by His blood
Will rise to meet Him in the air
Earth and sea shall flee away
All creation waits and groans
For the Lord Redeemer comes
To take His longing exiles home

CHORUS
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Come, O Lord, on earth to reign
Hallelujah, hallelujah
We await the coming day

VERSE 2
Those who mocked and scorned His name
Pierced and nailed Him to the tree
Deeply wail, in sorrow grieve
When they the true Messiah see
Every eye will see the Lord
Dressed in dreadful majesty
Every knee shall bow before
The Judge of all eternity

VERSE 3
Still He bears the holy scars
Evidence of saving grace
All the saints bought by His blood
Shall then rejoice to see His face
Yes, amen, let all adore
Christ on His eternal throne
All the pow'r and might are Yours
Come, claim the kingdom as Your own

329 SEE HOW HE LOVES US

Verse 1
King of heav'n, robed in light
Sovereign of all, angels adore Him
Came and set His crown aside
Emptied Himself, leaving His glory
See how He loves us

Son of Man, robed in flesh
Bearing our grief, knowing our weakness
Yet despised in our eyes
Pitied and poor, living among us
See how He loves us

Jesus, only Jesus, oh, how marvelous
Oh, how wonderful Your love

VERSE 1
See the destined day arise!

Wrath so great and justice fair?
Every pang and bitter throe,
Finishing Your life of woe?

REFRAIN
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Lamb of God for sinners slain!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Jesus Christ, we praise Your name!

VERSE 2
Who but Christ had dared to drain,
Steeped in gall, the cup of pain
And with tender body bear
Thorns and nails and piercing spear?
Slain for us, the water flowed,
Mingled from Your side with blood;
Sign to all attesting eyes
Of the finished sacrifice.

VERSE 3
Holy Jesus, grant us grace
In that sacrifice to place
All our trust for life renewed,
Pardoned sin, and promised good.
Grant us grace to sing Your praise
'Round Your throne through endless days,
Ever with the sons of light:
"Blessing, honor, glory, might!"

331 SHINE INTO OUR NIGHT

VERSE 1
We are not what we should be
We haven't sought what we should seek
We've seen Your glory, Lord, but looked away
Our hearts are bent, our eyes are dim
Our finest works are stained with sin
And emptiness has shadowed all our ways

CHORUS
Jesus Christ, shine into our night
Drive our dark away
Till Your glory fills our eyes
Jesus Christ, shine into our night
Bind us to Your cross, where we find life

VERSE 2
Still we often go astray
We chase the world, forget Your grace

Reveal the depths of what You've done
The death You died, the vict'ry won
You made a way for us to know Your love

And Your love endures
With tender cords
You drew us who had strayed so far
And like a might warrior stormed our hearts
Until we were Yours

Lift our hearts and holy hands
We will sing to You who loved us
We'll sing the song of the Lamb
We'll sing the song of the Lamb

Glorious God
Emptied to become like us
A humble servant taking up a cross
To pour out Your grace

Than fathom all Your love
Like a never ceasing stream
Are mercies through Your Son
The death of Christ alone
Deserves eternal song

No thanks is deep enough
No life is long enough
To tell of all You've done
No shout is loud enough
No words are strong enough
No song is sweet enough

Your mercies never change
Before You made the sun
Your love was set on us
For all Your faithfulness
Receive my gratefulness

345 STRICKEN, SMITTEN, AND AFFLICTED

VERSE 1
Stricken, smitten, and afflicted
See Him dying on the tree!
'Tis the Christ by man rejected
Yes, my soul, 'tis He, 'tis He!
'Tis the long-expected Prophet
David's son, yet David's Lord
By His Son God now has spoken
'Tis the true and faithful Word

VERSE 2
Tell me, ye who hear Him groaning
Was there ever grief like His?
Friends through fear His cause disowning
Foes insulting His distress
Many hands were raised to wound Him
None would interpose to save
But the deepest stroke that pierced Him
Was the stroke that Justice gave

VERSE 3
Ye who think of sin but lightly
Nor suppose the evil great
Here may view its nature rightly
Here its guilt may estimate
Mark the sacrifice appointed
See who bears the awful load
'Tis the Word, the Lord's Anointed
Son of Man and Son of God

VERSE 4
Here we have a firm foundation
Here the refuge of the lost
Christ, the Rock of our salvation
His the name of which we boast
Lamb of God, for sinners wounded
Sacrifice to cancel guilt!
None shall ever be confounded
Who on Him their hope have built

I surrender all

VERSE 2
Take all my cravings for vain recognition
Fleshly indulgence and worldly ambition
I want so much Lord to make You the focus
To serve You in secret and never be noticed

Take all my hunger for all that's forbidden
Every desire and sin I keep hidden
Search me and know me I want to bring to You
A life that is holy and sanctified through You

VERSE 1
When I was poor and helpless
The Lord, He heard my cry
He saved this wicked sinner
The King redeemed my life

Our God is good

You're near me when I'm broken
My comfort when I'm crushed
My hope in all afflictions
My God in whom I trust

I'll make my boast in Jesus
The One who is my life
His glory is my gladness
In Him I'm satisfied

348 THAT I MIGHT GAIN CHRIST

What I once called gain

I've been captivated by the cross
You steal my breath away
With that display of love
I want to see the face
Of Your glorious Son

BRIDGE
Lord be my single vision
I'll run my race to receive my crown
But You are the greatest gift I've been given
Help me lay all my other treasure down

That I might gain Christ
That I might know You
That I might find life
Help me lose what I must lose
That I might gain Christ
That I might gain Christ

VERSE 2

So come and dwell with me
Spirit inhabit my heart

One center of my life
To glorify Him who bears the scars of grace
And to walk worthy of His name
For all my days

CHORUS
With all my heart and soul and strength
In every word and thought and deed
I'll live for Him who died for me
To please the Audience of One
How can I not pledge all my love
In light of all that He has done?
There is one glory that I seek
To please the Audience of One

VERSE 2
Let me seek one prize, one great reward
One hope I treasure most
To hear the Father say, "My child, well done
Come enter into all the joy
Found in my Son"

350 THE FATHER'S LOVE

VERSE 1
How has the sinner been forgiven
How has the rebel been made clean
Or blinded eyes been made to see
How have the orphans been adopted
Who hated Your love and ran from grace
Despised and rejected all Your ways

CHORUS
How wonderful the Father's love
The Father's love for us
That He would send His only Son
To come and rescue us
He has saved us, called us blameless
Guides us now and will sustain us
Oh how wonderful the Father's love

VERSE 2
Your mercy floods our lives with kindness
Your grace has colored all we see
And You have promised not to leave
You freely give Your Spirit to us
So we can be sure we're sons of God
And rest in the hope of what's to come

Though sufferings may fill our lives
We're confident we're heirs with Christ
And so we cry, "Abba, Father"

351 THE FINAL WORD IS CHRIST

VERSE 1 
Why should my doubts and questions rise
With every passing storm?
Why does my heart believe the lies
That God would do me harm?
To this madness and my unbelief
My God, you have replied:
"I've not spared my only Son from grief
For you, for you He died!"

VERSE 2
How deep, how full, how sweet the word
That good shall come to pass
That every sorrow, sovereign Lord
Shall be transformed at last
My mind cannot perceive the end
Nor make sense of the means
But on Christ the Lord my soul depends
And on His promise leans

VERSE 3
Take care, my soul, let praises rise
When God wills strife or peace
Forbid the unbelieving lies
That overlook His grace
Oh, sing again of Jesus Christ
His cruel and bitter cross
Come, give your all, pour out your life
Count everything as loss

VERSE 4
Now, what shall come between us, Lord
And who can cut the ties
That You have made by shedding blood
With agonies and cries?
Shall humans, devils, powers here
Come take my source, my life?
Have peace, my soul, cast off your fears
The final word is Christ!

Majesty and might

By his death I live again

360 THE GOSPEL WAS PROMISED

VERSE 1 
The gospel was promised by sages and prophets
The Scriptures spoke of a Son
Descendant of David, and yet uncreated
Clothed in our flesh He would come
Predestined to seek us

The grave could not hold Him
The glorious Son of God

And now we live only
To make His glory known

Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb
Redeemed through Your infinite mercy
Your child and forever I am

VERSE 1

The deepest worship in the highest place
Be to You, Lord, it all belongs to You
The greatest honors that we can bring

Verse 1
O lift your eyes to heaven, see
The Holy One eternal
Behold the Lord of majesty
Exalted in His temple
As symphonies of angels praise
Now strain to sound His glory
Come worship, fall before His grace
The King in all His beauty

Chorus
How worthy, how worthy, how worthy
The King in all His beauty

Verse 2
Now see the King who wears a crown
One made of shame and splinters
The sacrifice for ruined man
The substitute for sinners
As earth is stained with royal blood
And quakes with love and fury
He breathes His last and bows His head
The King in all His beauty

Verse 3
Now see the Savior lifted up
The Lamb who reigns in splendor
The hope of every tribe and tongue
His kingdom is forever!
Bring praise and honor to His courts
Bring wisdom, power, blessing
For endless ages we'll adore
The King in all His beauty

364 THE LOOK

VERSE 1
I saw one hanging on a tree
In agony and blood
Who fixed His loving eyes on me
As near His cross I stood
And never till my dying breath
Will I forget that look
It seemed to charge me with His death
Though not a word He spoke

VERSE 2
My conscience felt and owned the guilt
And plunged me in despair
I saw my sins His blood had spilt
And helped to nail Him there
But with a second look He said
"I freely all forgive
This blood is for your ransom paid
I died that you might live"

CHORUS
Forever etched upon my mind
Is the look of Him who died
The Lamb I crucified
And now my life will sing the praise
Of pure atoning grace
That looked on me and gladly took my place

VERSE 3
Thus while His death my sin displays
For all the world to view
Such is the mystery of grace
It seals my pardon too
With pleasing grief and mournful joy
My spirit now is filled
That I should such a life destroy
Yet live by Him I killed

365 THE LORD ALMIGHTY REIGNS (PSALM 93)

God from everlasting, just in His decrees
Behold Him, worthy of our trust
Faithful to His promise, ever here with us

He reigns amidst the flood, He reigns with grace and love
Enthroned on high the Lord Almighty reigns

Would be ransomed by Your hand

You're the first and You're the last
You know the future from the past

Kingdoms rise at Your command
To bring You praise

Your glory is displayed for all to see

So with the heavens we'd proclaim

370 THE PRECIOUS BLOOD

VERSE 1
Before the cross I kneel and see
The measure of my sin
How You became a curse for me
Though You were innocent
The magnitude of Your great love
Was shown in full degree
When righteous blood, the crimson spill
Rained down from Calvary

CHORUS
Oh, the precious blood
That flowed from Mercy's side
Washed away my sin
When Christ my Savior died
Oh, the precious blood
Of Christ the crucified
It speaks for me before Your throne
Where I stand justified

VERSE 2
And who am I that I should know
This treasure of such worth
My Savior's pure atoning blood
Shed for the wrath I'd earned
For sin has stained my every deed
My every word and thought
What wondrous love that makes me one
Your priceless blood has bought

BRIDGE
A crown of thorns, pierced hands and feet
A body bruised, and Mercy's plea

371 THE PRODIGAL

VERSE 1
You held out Your arms, I walked away
Insolent, I spurned Your face
Squandering the gifts You gave to me
Holding close forbidden things
Destitute, a rebel still, a fool in all my pride
The world I once enjoyed is death to me
No joy, no hope, no life

VERSE 2
Where now are the friends that I had bought
Gone with every penny lost
What hope could there be for such as I
Sold out to a world of lies
Oh to see Your face again, it seems so distant now
Could it be that You would take me back
A servant in Your house

VERSE 3
You held out Your arms, I see them still
You never left, You never will
Running to embrace me, now I know
Your cords of love will always hold
Mercy's robe, a ring of grace
Such favor undeserved
You sing over me and celebrate
The rebel now Your child

372 THE SANDS OF TIME ARE SINKING

VERSE 1
The sands of time are sinking,
The dawn of Heaven breaks;
The summer morn I've sighed for,
The fair, sweet morn awakes;
Dark, dark hath been the midnight,
But dayspring is at hand,
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

VERSE 2
The King there in His beauty,
Without a veil is seen;
It were a well spent journey,
Though sev'n deaths lay between;
The Lamb with His fair army
Doth on Mount Zion stand,
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

VERSE 3
O Christ, He is the fountain,
The deep, deep well of love;
The streams on earth I've tasted,
More deep I'll drink above;
There to an ocean fullness
His mercy doth expand,
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

VERSE 4
With mercy and with judgment
My web of time He wove;
And always dews of sorrow
Were lustered with His love;
I'll bless the hand that guided,
I'll bless the heart that planned,
When throned where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

VERSE 5
Oh! I am my Beloved's
And my Beloved's mine!
He brings a poor, vile sinner
Into His "house of wine;"
I stand upon His merit,
I know no other stand,
Not e'en where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

VERSE 6
The bride eyes not her garments,
But her dear Bridegroom's face;
I will not gaze at glory
But on my King of grace;
Not at the crown He giveth,
But on His pierced hand;
The Lamb is all the glory
Of Immanuel's land.

373 THE SCARIEST SONG

VERSE 1
What's the scariest of woes?
Some say snakes and some say spiders
What strikes terror to your toes?
Some say floods and some say fires
Some say dentist drills or creepy clowns
Climbing up or falling down
But I'll tell you what's the scariest around

CHORUS
Sin-it's the scariest
Sin hurts everyone
Sin-how it hides in us
It's all the wrong we've done
It separates us from our God
Behind these prison walls
Oh, sin is the scariest of all

VERSE 2
What's the scariest to you?
Some say living, some say dying
What's the worst thing you can do?
Some say failing when they're trying
Some say getting germs or getting shots
Getting lost or getting caught
But I'll tell you what's
The worst thing we have got

BRIDGE
Since Adam and since Eve
Sin's spread like a disease
We know that on our own we cannot beat it
But though it seeks to kill
Our God is stronger still
And only by His grace can we defeat it

374 THE SON OF GOD CAME DOWN

VERSE 1
The Son of God came down and laid aside His crown
Born without great renown, this Sovereign One
All holiness and might, all glory shining bright
Have come to earth this night in Mary's son
O come, let us adore

CHORUS
O Christ the Lord, our hope and Savior
Son of God yet made like us
O Christ the Lord, our King adored
Born a child, our Lord Jesus

VERSE 2
Messiah born so small, asleep in cattle stall
Come to redeem our fall, nailed to a tree
This tiny, helpless child through death would reconcile
The holy God and vile, His grace so free
O come, let us adore

375 THE STEADFAST LOVE OF CHRIST

VERSE 1
Once my heart was a prison, defiled and cold
Where sin and the enemy reigned
I was bound by the chains that enslaved my soul
No hint of repentance or shame
But then Jesus appeared like the morning sun
Defeating the shadows with light
And forgiveness flowed through His precious blood
Oh, the steadfast love of Christ

VERSE 2
Though redeemed I still battle the lies within
That silently war in my soul
In my weakness I yield to the power of sin
And desperately cry out for hope
But then grace rushes in like a mighty flood
New strength to engage in the fight
And I taste the freedom the cross has won
Through the steadfast love of Christ

VERSE 3
All the world is accursed and in sorrow still
As heartache and suffering remain
But the hope of creation will be fulfilled
Our Savior is coming to reign
I believe in the justice of God the Son
I know faith will turn into sight
Every tear stain dried, every wound undone
By the steadfast love of Christ

TAG
All of Heaven will quake when we see our King
The Lamb on the throne, lifted high
We'll behold in awe and forever sing
Of the steadfast love of Christ
Oh, the steadfast love of Christ

376 THE UNBELIEVABLE

VERSE 1
Come and see the inconceivable
And believe the unbelievable
God has come to dwell with us
Begotten Son born into Adam's earth
Promised One fulfilling ancient words
God has come to dwell with us

BRIDGE
Who could ever know the depths
Of the myst'ry of Your grace?
Though our minds can't take it in
Lord, our hearts are filled with praise

VERSE 2
He will heal the unhealable
He will save the unsavable
God has come to dwell with us
Heaven's joy will drink our bitter cup
Emptied out as He is lifted up
God has come to dwell with us

VERSE 3
Lord, we're lost in overwhelming awe
At the thought of such amazing love
God has come, God has come
God has come to dwell with us

377 THERE BLOOMS A ROSE IN BETHLEHEM

VERSE 1
There blooms a rose in Bethlehem
From tender stem hath sprung
Of Jesse's line this flower grows
As men of old have sung
Isaiah told us long ago
About this rose we'd find
In virgin arms we shall behold
The Savior of mankind

VERSE 2
The glories of the heavens
Surrounded shepherds bright
The angels sang, a sign was shown
The Christ was born that night
What mystery they came upon
The sign the heralds laud
In manger slept the Holy One
In flesh, the Son of God

VERSE 3
This flow'r in bloom, a scent so sweet
That greets us in the air
It has dispelled with hopefulness
The sting of death's despair
Foretold, this rose was born to die
But would not see decay
So those who place their faith in Him
Shall blossom from the grave

378 THERE IS A FOUNTAIN FILLED WITH BLOOD

VERSE 1
There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins
And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains, lose all their guilty stains
And sinners plunged beneath that flood lose all their guilty stains

VERSE 2
The dying thief rejoiced to see that fountain in his day
And there have I, though vile as he, washed all my sins away
Washed all my sins away, washed all my sins away
And there have I, though vile as he, washed all my sins away

VERSE 3
Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood shall never lose its pow'r
Till all the ransomed church of God be saved, to sin no more
Be saved, to sin no more, be saved, to sin no more
Till all the ransomed church of God be saved, to sin no more

VERSE 4
E'er since by faith I saw the stream Thy flowing wounds supply
Redeeming love has been my theme, and shall be till I die
And shall be till I die, and shall be till I die
Redeeming love has been my theme, and shall be till I die

VERSE 5
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue lies silent in the grave
Then in a nobler, sweeter song, I'll sing Thy pow'r to save
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save, I'll sing Thy pow'r to save
Then in a nobler, sweeter song, I'll sing Thy pow'r to save

379 THERE IS ONE REASON

VERSE 1
There is one reason why we're gathered here
Your love is causing us to sing
All of Your people through Your Son draw near
Sinners before their holy King
The church of God bought by blood

CHORUS
We love You, Father
God of all, our God forever
We praise You, Jesus
Christ our Lord, the Son, our Savior
We're here together
In Your Holy Spirit gathered for Your glory

VERSE 2
There's a foundation that we're building on
Rooted in Jesus Christ alone
Every believer firmly fixed upon
Our everlasting cornerstone
The church of God built by love

BRIDGE
One Body, one baptism
One hope to which we have been called
One faith, one Lord, one Spirit
One sovereign ruler over all

We love You, Father
We praise You, Jesus
We're here together
For Your glory

380 THIS FATHOMLESS LOVE

VERSE 1
Lord, what moved Your heart to love lowly man
Before any star could herald Your praise?
And why did You come, abasing Yourself
Veiled in a robe of frail human clay?
Why would You, the pure, give Your life for the vile
The innocent seeking the guilty
To be reconciled?

CHORUS
I can't comprehend this fathomless love
I'm gripped and amazed at what You have done
Why would the adored become the despised
To bear all the furious wrath that was mine?
How awesome this mystery
Of Your fathomless love for me

VERSE 2
Why would You adopt and take as Your own
Those who had crushed Your one precious Son?
Why mercy and grace towards Your enemies?
Your name they have cursed and Your throne they have shunned
Oh, how could You choose to show kindness to these?
The ones who would mock You and hate You
The ones just like me?

381 THIS IS OUR GOD

VERSE 1
God, our Father, full of power
Maker of the heavens, Maker of the world
Forming all things, seen and unseen
Truly the Almighty beyond all measured worth
Holy is His Name

CHORUS
We believe the Lord our God is One
Father, Spirit, Son; This is our God!
We believe forever He will reign
Let the church proclaim: This is our God!

VERSE 2
Our Lord Jesus sent to save us
Born unto a virgin, lived a perfect life
Greatly suffered, dying for us
From the grave He's risen, seated now on high
Holy is His Name

BRIDGE
Jesus will come back again
To judge the living and the dead
Usher in the age to come
Let everyone sing "Amen"

VERSE 3
Spirit, holy, One in glory
Speaking through the prophets
Empowering the Church
Life is given by and through Him
With the Son and Father, worshiped and adored
Holy is His Name

382 THREE IN ONE

VERSE 1
Gracious Father
It was Your love for the world
That moved You to send your only Son
Gracious Father
This was your plan from all time
To have a people to call your own
Gracious Father
Full of mercy, I sing Your praise

CHORUS
Father, I love You
Praise You Jesus, only Son
Spirit, I adore You
Holy God, Three in One

VERSE 2
Precious Jesus
Though You were reigning on high
Humbly You came and were born a man
Precious Jesus
You were the servant of all
You gave Your life as the Father planned
Precious Jesus
Full of kindness, I sing Your praise

VERSE 3
Holy Spirit
You bring this good news to men
You open up blinded eyes to see
Holy Spirit
Come now and open my heart
Reveal the Lord Jesus Christ to me
Holy Spirit
Full of power, I sing Your praise

383 THROUGH THE PRECIOUS BLOOD

VERSE 1
You have ordained every breath we take
In pleasure or pain, there is no mistake
Gladness and grief, both are in Your hand
And sufferings brief carry out Your plan
And our fleeting sorrows
Will yield an endless prize
When some bright tomorrow
We'll see You with our eyes, and

CHORUS
Grace upon grace flows down, flows down
Grace upon grace flows down, flows down
Through the precious blood of Christ

VERSE 2
Father of lights, Giver of all grace
Your mercies crown our lives all our days
River of Life, quench our thirsty souls
For no true delight does Your love withhold
And in every season
We are satisfied
For just one reason:
Christ was crucified

BRIDGE
All good gifts, every good thing
Comes to us freely, so freely
All good gifts, every good thing
Comes to us freely, so freely
Through the precious blood
Through the precious blood

384 TO BE LIKE JESUS

VERSE 1
Love, joy, peace, and patience too
Grow in those who trust in You
All who put their hope in Christ
Kindness, goodness, faithfulness
Self-control and gentleness
Live in those who have new life

CHORUS
I want to be like Jesus
To walk and talk like Jesus
I want to live like one who follows Him
I want to love like Jesus
To give my all like Jesus
I want to live like one who follows Him

VERSE 2
I don't always do what's right
Jesus lived a perfect life
And for sins like mine He died
Teach me to obey Your Word
Help me to put others first
Holy Spirit, change my life

385 TO LIVE IS CHRIST

VERSE 1
Before You gave us life and breath
You numbered all our days
You set Your gracious love on us
And chose us to be saved
This fleeting life is passing by
With all its joys and pain
But we believe to live is Christ
And death is gain

CHORUS
To live is Christ, to die is gain
In every age this truth remains
We will not fear, we're unashamed
To live is Christ, to die is gain
To live is Christ, to die is gain

VERSE 2
And though we grieve for those we love
Who fall asleep in Christ
We know they'll see the Savior's face
And gaze into His eyes
So now we grieve, yet we don't grieve
As those who have no hope
For just as Jesus rose again
He'll raise His own

VERSE 3
And now we're longing for the day
We'll see the Lamb once slain
Who saved a countless multitude
To glorify His name
We're yearning for the wedding feast
Of Jesus and His bride
His nail-scarred hands will finally
Bring us to His side

386 TO TELL THE TRUTH

CHORUS
To tell the truth is what I want to do
Because You love the lips that speak the truth
To tell a lie leads me away from You
So help me, God, to tell the truth

VERSE 1
Your Words will last forever
They never change or fade
You never break a promise
We can trust all You say
But when my words aren't truthful
I'm doing something wrong
They'll only last a moment
Suddenly they'll be gone

VERSE 2
A little lie seems harmless
Like ordinary words
But lies we tell to others
Are like a sword that hurts
When someone tries to tell me
That covering up's okay
Don't let me be dishonest
Help me to humbly say

387 TOTALLY GOD, TOTALLY MAN

INTRO
Jesus, He's fully God and fully man
That's really hard to understand
So, let me try to explain

VERSE 1
Jesus, His Word upholds the galaxies
But He babbled like a baby
In His mother's arms
Jesus understands the universe
But He had to go to school to learn
How to write His name

VERSE 2
Jesus walked upon the ocean blue
But His feet got tired and dirty too
On the dusty roads
Jesus cried when His friend Lazarus died
But His power brought Him back to life
When He called his name

CHORUS
He's totally God and totally man
Both in One, He's the great I AM
To save the world, fulfill God's plan
He had to be totally God, totally man

VERSE 3
Jesus obeyed His Father perfectly
And we know that's something you and me
Couldn't ever do
Jesus died to pay for all our sins
Rose to save the ones who trust in Him
For eternity

388 TRUST IN THE LORD

VERSE 1
My father said, "Don't forget my teaching
But hold on tight to my commands
For long life and peace they will add to you
Don't let love and kindness leave you
Write them down upon your heart
And God and people will smile on you"

CHORUS 1
Trust in the Lord with all your heart
And do not lean on your own understanding
In all your ways acknowledge Him
And He'll make straight all your paths
Trust in the Lord

VERSE 2
My father said, "Don't be wise in your eyes
But fear the Lord and turn from sin
And God will heal you and give you strength"
Look to Jesus to be your treasure
He's worth more than jewels and gold
For He's more precious than anything

BRIDGE
Jesus, You're my confidence, Jesus, You're my hope
You will keep my feet from stumbling
Jesus, You're my confidence, Jesus, You're my hope
You will keep my feet from stumbling

CHORUS 2
I'll trust in the Lord with all my heart
And will not lean on my own understanding
In all my ways I'll acknowledge Him
And He'll make straight all my paths
Trust in the Lord

389 TURN YOUR EYES

VERSE 1
Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in His wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace

VERSE 2
Turn your eyes to the hillside
Where justice and mercy embraced
There the Son of God gave His life for us
And our measureless debt was erased

CHORUS
Jesus, to You we lift our eyes
Jesus, our glory and our prize
We adore You, behold You, our Savior ever true
Oh Jesus, we turn our eyes to You

VERSE 3
Turn your eyes to the morning
And see Christ the Lion awake
What a glorious dawn, fear of death is gone
For we carry His life in our veins

VERSE 4
Turn your eyes to the heavens
Our King will return for His own
Every knee will bow, every tongue will shout,
'All glory to Jesus alone!'

390 TURN YOUR EYES REPRISE

Turn your eyes to the heavens
Our King will return for His own
Every knee will bow, every tongue will shout,
'All glory to Jesus alone!'

391 TURN YOUR EYES UPON JESUS

Turn your eyes upon Jesus
Look full in His wonderful face
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim
In the light of His glory and grace

392 UNASHAMED

VERSE 1
You were not ashamed to be
Emptied and poured out to death
Unashamed to give Your dying breath
You were not ashamed to bear
All of my reproach and sin
Jesus, You were such a faithful friend
So I will glory in the cross
And in the blood You shed for us
Glory in the gospel of Your grace

CHORUS
Let me be unashamed
Jesus, to speak Your name
For You were the one who came
The Savior of the world
Let me be unashamed
Jesus, to speak Your name
Let me be bold to claim
You as my Lord

VERSE 2
You were not ashamed to give
Your body to a Roman lash
Unashamed to bear God's holy wrath
You were not ashamed to hang
Naked bleeding on a tree
Gladly You did all of this for me
So I will glory in the cross
And in the blood you shed for us
Glory in the gospel of Your grace

393 UNDONE

VERSE 1
Your Spirit had awakened
Our lifeless hearts to see
The King in brilliant glory
Revealed in majesty
We were ruined in Your presence
And tearing at the seams
Our eyes had gazed upon the King of kings

CHORUS
We fall down in awe of You
We fall down, undone
We fall down before You, Lord
Undone

VERSE 2
Our hands had crafted idols
Our lips had spoken lies
Every wayward thought we had
Against us testified
But You were rich in mercy
To provide what You demand
And now on Christ, the solid rock, we stand

BRIDGE
Holy, Holy, Holy One

394 UNDYING LOVE

VERSE 1
My ears had heard of You, now I have seen
This bitter sweetness in Your agony
My heart was far from You, but You drew me near
With loving kindness dried every tear

CHORUS
And I can see You
Bearing all my shame on the cross
I can hear You cry out, "It is done"
O Jesus, Your sacrifice was more than enough
In Your death I see undying love

VERSE 2
My heart is broken, I'm down on my knees
To see my Savior suffering for me
But You descended, lifting me up
Washing my feet, filling my cup

395 W-I-S-D-O-M

VERSE 1
There is something that's better than the latest toy
There is something that never can be destroyed
It's worth more than jewels and gold
Or anything money can buy

CHORUS
W-I-S-D-O-M spells wisdom, I need it
W-I-S-D-O-M in Your Word, I find it
I need Your wisdom, Lord, each day

VERSE 2
Left to my own self I always tend to go astray
But in the Bible You reveal Your perfect ways
You teach me to think like You
Instead of being a fool

BRIDGE
I wanna love it, live it, learn it, read it (W-I-S-D-O-M!)
I wanna know it, think it, speak it, breathe it (W-I-S-D-O-M!)

396 WE ARE NOT ASHAMED

CHORUS
We, we are not ashamed
For the gospel is the power of God to save
Yes, we, we are not ashamed
For we have no other Savior to proclaim
Christ alone, the Life, the Truth, the Way

VERSE 1
The news of Jesus Christ, the crucified
Risen, reigning at the Father's side
Is foolishness to those who cannot see
Blinded by the lies they have believed

PRE-CHORUS
So, let the Church arise, let the anthem ring
Till all the world has heard of Christ the Risen King
The song of the redeemed boldly we shall sing
The hope of all the world is Christ the Risen King!

VERSE 2
The enemies of God are in a rage
Opposing Him, their efforts are in vain
Through every age the gospel will endure
The Spirit's with the Church forevermore

LAST CHORUS
We, we are not ashamed
For we have a sure foundation in His grace
Yes, we, we are not ashamed
For we have a great salvation in His name
Christ alone, the Life, the Truth, the Way

397 WE ARE YOURS FOREVER

VERSE 1
O God, when You spoke into darkness
And said, "Let there be," and it was
You made us the crown of creation
To share in Your love
And when we rejected Your goodness
To follow our foolish desires
You knew that one day You'd redeem us
Through one sacrifice

CHORUS
Oh, what a love You have lavished on us
To call us Your children, daughters and sons
One with the Savior, bought by His blood
We are Yours forever

VERSE 2
By grace You have made us Your family
We're kept in Your kindness and care
With boldness we know we can bring You
Each burden we bear
And though we are longing to see You
Your Spirit within testifies
That we are adopted and treasured
Til faith becomes sight

BRIDGE
What now can separate us
From the hope You gave us
We will be like Christ our King
We are Yours forever

398 WE GIVE THANKS (PSALM 107)

VERSE 1
Once in the wilderness of our sin
We wandered lost and without hope
Into our desert waste God in grace
Came to restore and bring us home
Let the redeemed of God rise up and sing

CHORUS
We give thanks, O God, for Your steadfast love
We give thanks, O God, for You are good
Lord, You are good, we give thanks

VERSE 2
Through every pain and trial, You provide
Light in the dark of our distress
Lifting us from on high when we cry
Turning our grief to gratefulness
Let the redeemed of God rise up and sing

BRIDGE
You take the darkness and make it as light
Hearts that were dead in sin, You raise to life
You take a barren place and make it a spring
Let the redeemed of God rise up and sing
Let the redeemed of God rise up and sing!

399 WE HAVE BEEN HEALED

VERSE 1
You bore our sins in Your body
As You were hung on a tree
So we might die to rebellion
And live for Him who set us free

VERSE 2
You were mocked and reviled
Suffering in our place
Trusting all to Your Father
So enemies could know Your grace

CHORUS
We have been healed, justified
Made alive in the life of Christ
Righteous blood covers every sin
Risen Lamb, heaven's light
Crucified and now alive
In Your love, You have drawn us in

VERSE 3
Like straying sheep we were wandering
Destitute and alone
You sought us out like a Shepherd
You carried us and brought us home

BRIDGE
All our sin for Your grace
What a glorious exchange
All our sin for Your grace
What a glorious exchange
All our sin for Your grace

400 WE HUNGER AND THIRST

VERSE 1
Exalted Son of glory humbly came down
Wounded for the broken, bore the sinner's crown
Through the willing death You died
You became our bread of life

CHORUS
Jesus, we hunger and thirst for You, Lord
As we remember Your sacrifice
We see the wounds from Your hands and pierced side
Extravagant love! Oh how great the price
Now our lives are Yours

VERSE 2
The priceless blood of Jesus, this gracious cup
A life spring overflowing, poured out for us
He has conquered every sin
For the ones who trust in Him

BRIDGE
The cup we drink, the bread we eat
Reminds us You are all we need
And makes us long for Your wedding feast

401 WE LOOK TO YOU

VERSE 1
Deliver us from evil, Lord;
We sojourn in a broken world
Though evil hands give rise to war,
Remind us this is not our home
We look to You, we look to You,
Sovereign King of all the earth
We look to You, we look to You;
In Your strength we will endure
In Your strength we will endure

VERSE 2
Deliver us from evil, Lord;
Our hearts so quickly run astray
Temptation crouching at the door
To turn us from the narrow way
We look to You, we look to You,
Christ the conquering Son of God
We look to You, we look to You;
Lord, complete what You've begun
Lord, complete what You've begun

VERSE 3
Deliver us from evil, Lord;
The devil's seeking to devour
With trembling hearts we hear his roar,
But Your strong arm will crush his pow'r
We look to You, we look to You,
Come and end his earthly reign
We look to You, we look to You;
Lord, deliver us, we pray

TAG
We look to You, we look to You
You will come again to reign
We look to You, we look to You
All the earth will bow in praise

Holy Judge of earth and heaven
Forever just and without flaw
Only doing what is right
In Your kindness and Your mercy
You've revealed to us Your law
We praise Your righteousness, O God

We see Your righteousness, O God
In the keeping of Your promise
Your saving grace displayed to all
To restore a world gone wrong
As the threats of hell are silenced
By the cry upon the cross
We see Your righteousness, O God

TAG
Lord, You are just and You justify
All who trust in the blood of Christ

VERSE 3
We love Your righteousness, O God
You have owned us as Your children
Your gift to those that You have called
Through no merits of our own

Joined to Jesus Christ, our all
We love Your righteousness
We see Your righteousness
We praise Your righteousness, O God

403 WE RECEIVE

VERSE 1
Beautiful Savior
Fullness of heaven
Though we have nothing
Here we receive

VERSE 2
Jesus, You call us
Now to remember
You were the offering
For all who believe

CHORUS
You laid Your life on the table
Broken like bread, poured out like wine
We sing what a wonderful Savior
Jesus our King, all that You give we receive

VERSE 3
Pardon and blessing
Life everlasting
Mercy unmeasured
How can it be?

You are the Giver
Faithful forever
Help us to treasure
All we've received

For the price You paid
We pour out our praises
For this feast of grace
We thank you, Jesus

VERSE 1
We've come together in Your name
We've come together to proclaim
How great You are
Once we were going our own ways
Now we're a people for Your praise
How great You are

Sing to God our Father
All because of Jesus
We sing, His blood has bought us
Sing, Your mercy called us
All because of Jesus we sing

Jesus, You're powerful to save
Jesus, You've risen from the grave
How great You are
Your blood gave us peace with God
Your love has broken down our walls
How great You are

By grace we have been saved
To be Your dwelling place
You took our curse and made us one
It's nothing we could do
Our only boast is You
So we rejoice in what You've done

405 WE SING YOUR MERCIES

CHORUS
We sing Your mercies
We sing Your endless praises
We sing Your everlasting love
We sing Your mercies
We sing Your endless praises
Sovereign One who died
Sovereign One who died for us

VERSE 1
Should He who made the stars
Be hung upon a tree
And should the hands that healed
Be driven through for me?
Should He who gave us bread
Be made to swallow gall?
Should He who gave us breath and life
Be slaughtered for us all?

VERSE 2
Should He who is the light
Be cast into the dark?
And should the Lord of love
Be pierced through His own heart?
Should He who called us friends
Be deserted by us all
Should He who lived a sinless life
Be punished for our fall?

406 WE WILL GLORIFY

Lyrics and sheet music for this song are available on PraiseCharts.com.

407 WE WILL RISE

VERSE 1
A seed falls down from the heights
And is buried in the earth
It silently lies in the ground
Awaiting a rebirth
So it is with those who die
Their lips confessing Christ
Because He is risen
With Him they will rise

VERSE 2
Shall we mourn as this world mourns
Or shall we rest in truth?
Though outwardly we waste away
Within we are renewed
The weight of glory far transcends
These momentary trials
Because He is risen
With Him we will rise
We will rise

BRIDGE
Weeping may last for an evening
But rejoicing comes with the dawn

VERSE 3
To all the wonders God will do
Imagination's blind
What He has made He'll make anew
In the twinkling of an eye
For death itself will be destroyed
Swallowed up by life
Because He is risen
With Him we will rise
We will rise

408 WE WILL SEEK YOU

VERSE 1
Wise men saw a starry sign
And left their homes behind for You
We too have seen the Morning Star
And hope has filled our hearts anew
So like the wise men we will come

CHORUS
And we will seek You
We will seek You
We will seek You
Who sought us out to make us new
We will seek You

VERSE 2
Wise men traveled long and far
Following the star of God
But You've come closer than the air
You brought us near by Your own blood
So like the wise men we will come

VERSE 3
Wise men came with gifts of gold
Frankincense and myrrh for You
We'll bring hearts aflame with love
Gratefulness and praise to You
So like the wise men we will come

409 WELCOME IN

Based on Luke 16:19-31

VERSE 1
There was a wealthy man
Who feasted every day
But right outside from the dawn till night
A needy and sick man lay
But soon both men had died
And stood before their God
The rich man saw heaven can't be bought
The poor man found he was loved

VERSE 2
Our God in heaven is just
His eyes can bear no sin
His holiness and nothing less
Is needed to come to Him
For those who don't believe
God's judgment is their choice
But those made right through the blood of Christ
Will know the greatest of joys

VERSE 3
Both hell and heaven are real
And God wants us to know
That Christ endured what we each deserve
So heaven could be our home
And if we believe God's Son
Has paid for all our sin
Then, by His grace when we see His face
His smile will say, "Welcome in!"

410 WHAT A GLORIOUS MYSTERY

VERSE 1
Who can comprehend
Your holy ways O Lord
Your glorious power without end
From which the stars were born
How could we ever understand
The moving of Your hand?
How could we ever come to grasp
The One who never began?

CHORUS
Oh, what a glorious mystery You are
Oh, what a glorious mystery You are
Though we only see in part
You've completely won our hearts
Oh, what a glorious mystery You are

VERSE 2
Who can comprehend
Your gracious mercy Lord
Great loving kindness that would send
A Savior to be born?
Why would you, Jesus, die for us
Who cursed Your perfect name?
Why would You come to reconcile
Those who caused Your shame?

411 WHAT CHILD IS THIS

VERSE 1
What Child is this Who, laid to rest
On Mary's lap is sleeping?
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet
While shepherds watch are keeping?
This, this is Christ the King
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing
Haste, haste, to bring Him laud
The Babe, the Son of Mary

VERSE 2
Why lies He in such mean estate
Where ox and lamb are feeding?
Good Christian, fear, for sinners here
The silent Word is pleading
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through
The cross be borne for me, for you
Hail, hail the Word made flesh
The Babe, the Son of Mary

VERSE 3
So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh
Come peasant, king to own Him
The King of kings salvation brings
Let loving hearts enthrone Him
Raise, raise a song on high
The virgin sings her lullaby
Joy, joy for Christ is born
The Babe, the Son of Mary

412 WHAT YOU BEGAN

CHORUS
What You began You will finish
By Your strong hand I will prevail
Every trial You work in it
And Your faithfulness can't fail
Though I do not claim to understand
The mysteries of Your sovereign plan
I know the good work You began
You will finish

VERSE 1
You are the One who works
in ways I cannot grasp
You are the One who knows
My prayers before I ask
Why should I doubt You
When without You I'd be lost
When I am tossed on the sea
You bring me back to the land
And what You began

VERSE 2
You are the One who will work
All things for my good
You are the One who guards
My path before I look
Why should I try to walk
By sight and not by faith
Lord give me the grace to have
A childlike trust in Your plan
And what You began

414 WHEN CHRIST OUR LIFE APPEARS

VERSE 1
When Christ our life appears, our hope will be complete
Our longings finally rest as we fall at His feet
When Jesus comes to reign, restoring everything
Our tears will turn to tides of praises to our King
We're longing for that day when we'll see

CORO
Christ, our Savior
We'll behold the glory of our King forever
Christ, our Savior
Faith will turn to sight when Christ our life appears

When Christ our life appears, the curse will be undone
All wickedness will end as mercy overcomes
The Savior will renew what sin had torn apart
His light will drive the shadows from our weary hearts
We're longing for that day when we'll see

VERSE 3
When Christ our life appears, these trials that weighed us down
Will fade and fall away as He receives our crowns
And death will disappear, its rule and reign destroyed
Beneath the weight of glory and eternal joy
We're longing for that day when we'll see

415 WHEN I SURVEY THE WONDROUS CROSS

VERSE 1
When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.

VERSE 2
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
Save in the death of Christ, my God.
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

VERSE 3
See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down.
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

VERSE 4
Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small.
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

417 WHEN WE SEE YOUR FACE

VERSE 1
Though the dark is overwhelming
And the brightest lights grow dim
Though the Word of God
Is trampled on by foolish men
Though the wicked never stumble
And abound in every place
We will all be humbled when we see Your face

VERSE 2
And the demons we've been fighting
(Alt: And the enemies we're fighting)
Those without and those within
Will be underneath our feet
To never rise again
All our sins will be behind us
Through the blood of Christ erased
And we'll taste Your kindness when we see Your face

CHORUS
We will see, we will know
Like we've never known before
We'll be found, we'll be home
We'll be Yours forevermore

VERSE 3
All the waiting will be over
Every sorrow will be healed
All the dreams it seemed
Could never be will all be real
And You'll gather us together
In Your arms of endless grace
As Your Bride forever when we see Your face

TAG
And You'll gather us together
In your arms of endless grace
As Your Bride forever when we see Your face

418 WHEN YOU MOVE

VERSE 1
Father, come reveal the love
That You've freely given us
Poured from Calv'ry like a flood
We look to You
Spirit, move and shine Your light
Change our hearts and fill our minds
With the radiance of Christ
We look to You, we look to You

CHORUS
For when You move, our lives are changed
We know a taste of heaven here
We're crying out for more of You
Lord, come and move

VERSE 2
Father, You know all our needs
Long before we even speak
But Your heart is what we seek
We look to You
Jesus, come and build Your church
Let Your gospel fill the earth
Till the day that You return
We look to You, we look to You

419 WHERE IT ALL BEGINS

CHORUS
Here is where it all begins
Here's the key to every door
It is when we know the fear of the Lord

VERSE 1
When others try to draw you in
So you would join them in their sin
The fear of God will keep you safe
And give you strength to run away

VERSE 2
The Lord will bless the ones who search
For wisdom in His holy Word
He'll keep them from the devil's snares
He'll give them joy and hear their prayers!

BRIDGE
To fear the Lord, is to stand in awe
To love what's right and hate what's wrong
To fear the Lord, is to grow in love
For our great God who rules us all

420 WHO CAN SAY

VERSE 1
Who can say, "I have made my heart pure
I am clean from my sin"?
No one's blameless in God's holy eyes
That's why the Savior came

CHORUS
Jesus, Jesus, only You did everything right
Jesus, Jesus, died and rose
So we could have new life

VERSE 2
Who has perfectly followed God's law
Loving all of His ways?
The One who gave up His life in our place
Jesus, the King who saves

421 WHO HAS DONE GOOD

VERSE 1 
Who has done good and who has sought God?
We hated and cursed and called for Your blood
We claimed to be wise as we gloried in shame
We told ourselves lies, despising Your reign
And love, Your love, was far from us
And love, Your love, was far from us

VERSE 2
Our mouths were like graves, our words were like darts
Our bodies were slaves to the greed of our hearts
We thirsted for life as we wasted our breath
Entangled in strife, we rushed to our death
And love, Your love, was far from us
And love, Your love, was far from us

VERSE 3
The foolish You loved, the faithless You saved
The lost You have found, the worthless You raised
The blood of Your cross and Your empty grave
Made rebels to heirs and sinners to saints
And love, Your love, has come to us
And love, Your love, has come to us

422 WHO IS LIKE OUR GOD

VERSE 1
The Lord is not our equal
He doesn't need the help of man
Who could ever give Him counsel
Who could ever stop His sovereign plan
Though men may boast of wisdom
And be filled with pride within
Who is bold enough to answer
When his Maker comes to question him

VERSE 2
Though rulers rise against Him
The King of Heaven laughs
He rebukes them in His anger
And terrifies them in His wrath
He punishes the wicked
Pours judgment out on sin
Yet this Champion of Justice
Is a Savior if you call on Him

CHORUS
And we call on the name
Of the holy sovereign Lord
The King of all the earth
And we hope in the power
Of His awesome mighty hand
We tremble at His word
Who is like our God

VERSE 3
The heavens sound with thunder
As His majesty is shown
The four and twenty elders
Fall down and worship at His throne
His eyes are flames of fire
And His face is like the sun
He's the Alpha and Omega
The One who was and is to come

Who is like the Lord our God?

Our Lord Jesus wore our weakness to redeem us
Praise the name of the Lord!
In His kindness He will keep us now and forevermore

Crowned with adoration, He is high above the nations
Who is like the Lord our God?
Raised us from the ashes, He has turned our grief to gladness
Who is like the Lord our God?
Who is like the Lord our God?

High and holy, meek and lowly
There is no one like You
Our Messiah, here beside us
There is no one like You

424 WHO IS LIKE YOU

Who is like You, O Lord
Clothed with splendor and light?
Who is like You, O Lord
Armed with power and might?
And who am I
O Sovereign Lord, that I
Should know Your love?
Consuming fire, O Holy Majesty,
I know Your love
How great You are, O Lord
Your mercies are ever new
Oh, who am I, and who is like You?

425 WHO IS THIS

Verse 1
Who is this, divine and tender, hailing from eternal shores?
Once arrayed in highest splendor, now in poverty adorned
He is Jesus, God made mortal, Word in flesh, the Light of Life
From a throne room to a stable, hope is born this holy night

Verse 2
Who is this of might and meekness, given all authority?
With a word He stills the tempest, at His touch the blind can see
He is Jesus our Messiah, long awaited, long proclaimed
Sing "Hosanna in the highest!" Christ the King has come to reign

Verse 3
Who is this reviled and stricken broken on a cursed tree?
Son of God by God forsaken, drenched in our iniquity
He is Jesus slain for sinners, laiden with our guilt and grief
All our praise to Him we render for His wounds have won our peace

Verse 4
Who is this entombed in darkness, cast into the bitter depths?
He whom grave nor Hell could harness rose and tore the sting from death
He is Jesus, God triumphant, risen to the Father's side
All will bow in awe and reverence at the name of Jesus Christ

Tag
O come let us adore Him, O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him, Christ the LORD

426 WHO MADE ME TO KNOW YOU

VERSE 1
Who made me to know You, but You
When dead in sin You gave me new life
Now my heart is filled with love for You, Jesus

CHORUS
Father, thank You for Your Spirit's work in me
For opening my eyes to the Christ of Calvary
Jesus, You gave Your life in exchange for mine
Now I will live for You who died, Jesus

VERSE 2
You placed a crown of grace on my head
You covered me in robes of righteousness
Forever I will always be Yours, Jesus

427 WHO WOULD HAVE DREAMED

VERSE 1
On a starlit hillside, shepherds watched their sheep
Slowly, David's city drifted off to sleep
But to this little town of no great renown
The Lord had a promise to keep

VERSE 2
Prophets had foretold it, a mighty King would come
Long awaited Ruler, God's Anointed One
But the Sovereign of all looked helpless and small
As God gave the world His own Son

CHORUS
And who would have dreamed or ever foreseen
That we could hold God in our hands?
The Giver of Life is born in the night
Revealing God's glorious plan
To save the world

VERSE 3
Wondrous gift of heaven: the Father sends the Son
Planned from time eternal, moved by holy love
He will carry our curse and death He'll reverse
So we can be daughters and sons

VERSE 1
The people who walked in the darkness
Have seen a great light come
The people who dwelled in the shadows
Have seen a new day dawn

And to us a child is born
And the kingdom of the heavens
Is on His shoulders

CHORUS
And His name shall be Wonderful Counselor
Mighty God, Prince of Peace
His name shall be Wonderful Counselor
Mighty God, Prince of Peace
Savior of the world

VERSE 2
The gloom of the slave and the prisoner
Has lifted like a cloud
The ones who were crushed by their burdens
Rejoice and laugh out loud
And His kingdom will keep on increasing
His peace will have no end
He'll bring mercy, truth, and justice
By His own power

How can we not sing out to the One who saved us
And covered us with Your blood
Casting all our sin into Your sea of mercy
Crowning us with Your love?

And I'm consumed
With You and only You Jesus

What eyes of flesh could ever see
For I've beheld with trembling joy
The sight of Calvary's Scarlet Rose

CHORUS
You have exalted above all things

Adopted through Your Son
