So put on the armour the Lord has provided;
And place your defense in His unfailing care.

Lighting your path to avoid ev'ry snare.

Be strong in the Lord, and be of good courage;
Your mighty Commander will vanquish the foe.
Fear not the battle, for the vict'ry is always His;
He will protect you where-ever you go.

A            D             A
When deep water curls around you
    G             D
And fear replaces faith,
           G                      D
When the floods would seem to overwhelm
       Em           A
God’s promises of grace,
           D                 A
When the fires seems overtaking
G                  D
And all seems torn and tossed,
          G
Trust His Word, O truly listen,
D               Em A             Em A
Hear Him say, “All is not lost.”

Chorus:
              D A            G D
“Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid,
          G                     D               Em A
I have redeemed you; you are Mine; don’t be afraid.
           D A             G D
Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid,
           G                A7            D
You are a precious child to Me, Don’t be afraid.”

I am with you thru the water, I’m with you thru the flood.
They will never overwhelm you: I have bought you with My blood.
Even though you walk thru fire, I’ll go with you all the way.
I’m your Saviour, truly listen, Hear Me say, these words I say:

E                      B7           E
Once I was bound by sin’s galling fetters;
                        F#           B7
Chained like a slave, I struggled in vain.
E               B7         E
But I received a glorious freedom
A             E         B7        E
When Jesus broke my fetters in twain.

Chorus:
E                  E7          A
Glorious freedom! Wonderful freedom!
E                     F#      B7
No more in chains of sin I repine!
            E       B7          E
Jesus, the glorious mighty Redeemer!
A            E    B7       E
Now and forever Jesus is mine.

Freedom from all the carnal affections;
Freedom from envy, hatred, and strife;
Freedom from vain and worldly ambitions;
Freedom from all that saddened my life.

Freedom from pride and all sinful follies;
Freedom from love and glitter of gold;
Freedom from evil temper and anger -
Glorious freedom, rapture untold !

    D
In shady, green pastures, so rich and so sweet,
      A                        D
God leads His dear children along;
           D
Where the water’s cool flow bathes the weary one’s feet,
      A                        D
God leads his dear children along.

Chorus:
                             G                 D
Some through the waters, some through the flood,
                            E               A
Some through the fire, but all through the blood;
D                                  G            D
Some through great sorrow, but God gives a song,
                        A
In the night season and all the day long.

Sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright,
God leads His dear children along;
Sometimes in the valley, in darkest of night,
God leads His dear children along.

Though sorrows befall us and Satan oppose,
God leads His dear children along;
Through grace we can conquer, defeat all our foes,
God leads his dear children along.

Away from the mire and away from the clay,
God leads His dear children along;
Away up in glory, eternity’s day,
God leads his dear children along.

A      D       A
God is always near me,

Hearing what I say,
                  E          A
Knowing all my thoughts and deeds,
D      E          A
All my work and play.

God is always near me,
In the darkest night,
He can see me just the same,
As by mid-day light.

God is always near me,
Though so young and small;
Not a look or word or thought,
But God knows it all.

Like a river glorious is God’s perfect peace,

Over all victorious in its bright increase;
D                G D G          D     A
Perfect, yet it floweth fuller every day,
D         A Bm Em D                A7     D
Perfect, yet it groweth deeper all the way.

Chorus:
               G D A7            D A7
Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blest,
D        A7 Bm Em D              A7          D
Finding as He promised, perfect peace and rest.

Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand,
Never foe can follow, never traitor stand;
Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care,
Not a blast of hurry touch the spirit there.

Every joy or trial falleth from above,
Traced upon our dial by the Sun of Love:
We may trust Him fully all for us to do;
They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true.

Jesus will see you through;

Sing when the day is bright;
                    G
Sing through the darkest night;

Every day, all the way,
        C     D     G
Let us sing, sing, sing!

Knowing You will always lead me; Your will is always right

Chorus:

I know God makes no mistakes.
     E            Am
He leads in ev’ry path I take
   F        C         Am      F    G
Along the way that’s leading me to home.
          C        Dm
Tho’ at times my heart would break,
           E7               Am
There’s a purpose in ev’ry change He makes;
       F                    Dm
That others would see my life
                     G7           C
and know that God makes no mistakes.

And when some day in heav’n above I see His dear face,
May I then be counted faithful as a runner in this race.
But now I’m trusting in the Saviour to show me the way,
In His righteousness He guides me, as I seek to please Him day
by day.

G                C            D        G
Will your anchor hold in the storms of life,
D                                A       D
When the clouds unfold their wings of strife?
           G            D           D7     G
When the strong tides lift and the cables strain,

Will your anchor drift or firm remain?

Chorus:
G                       C           G
We have an anchor that keeps the soul
                                     D
Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
G                           C G C
Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
G                                D       G
Grounded firm and deep in the Savior’s love.

It is safely moored, ’twill the storm withstand,
For ‘tis well secured by the Saviour’s hand;
Tho the tempest rage and the winds blow,
Not an angry wave shall our bark o’er flow.

When our eyes behold thru the gath’ring night
The city of gold, our harbor bright,
We shall anchor fast by the heav’nly shore,
With the storms all past forevermore.

He will hold me fast, He will hold me fast;

For my Savior loves me so, He will hold me fast.

I could never keep my hold, He must hold me fast!
For my love is often cold, He must hold me fast! --

I am precious in His sight, He will hold me fast!
Those He saves are His delight, He will hold me fast! --

He will take care of you,

God will take care of you.

Through days of toil when heart doth fail,
God will take care of you;
When dangers fierce your path assail,
God will take care of you.

All you may need He will provide,
God will take care of you;
Trust Him, and you will be satisfied,
God will take care of you.

No matter what may be the test,
God will take care of you;
Lean, weary one upon His breast,
God will take care of you.

C                     F
When the scenes of life shift about us
           C              G
Like the backdrops in a play,
Dm                     F
Were our trust in the things that surround us,
         G                C
In the things that pass away,
E7          Am                                 F              Dm
We should then be full of confusion, without hope and in dismay.
         C                 D                            F     G
What a joy instead to be anchored to the rock that will ever stay!

Chorus:
       C G          Am            F      C          G
Then we will press onward, for Christ is still the same.
C         G       Am           F        C        G
What He was in ages past is what He will remain.
E       Am F               G          C
And forevermore that is what He will be,
     F       C     F E Am
For time and for e-ter-ni-ty!

He’s an unchanging Sa-vior, with an undying love.
C7       F G          Em Am      F        Dm G7 C
He’s an unchanging Sa-vior, our life, our sur-e--ty.

He alone laid the earth’s foundations
And then pronounced them good.
He alone can impart salvation
For he bought it with His blood.
Though the heathen vainly imagine they can cast his pow’r aside,
We will stake our claim on the all sufficient name that will ever
abide!

14 (4/4 Gmaj)

             G                 D
He walks beside me along the road;

“I’ll never leave thee,” His promise sure,
“I’ll not forsake thee, I’ll keep thee pure
Along the pathway so stained with sin;
I’ll give thee victory and peace within.”

I trust in Jesus along the way;
I trust in Jesus through every day.
His eye will guide me, though dark the night;
I trust in Jesus, He is my Light.

           C          C7 F
Though it seems I’m oft unnoticed
     C                G
And lost in time and space,
       C        C7      F
God above is watching o’er me,
           C      G7      C
Though I cannot see His face.

Chorus:

Higher hands are leading me,

I am not alone, I know,
      F
As I walk this world below,
     C                 G7    C
For higher hands are leading me.

O how sweet to know He hears me
When I go to Him in prayer;
And I tell Him all my troubles
When my heart is bowed with care.

There’s a great eternal purpose
In the life of everyone,
And someday we’ll know its meaning
When our days on earth are done.

All my times are in His keeping,
He has numbered me my years;
And someday He’ll take me yonder
Where there’ll be no pain or tears.

So I face an unknown future
Full of faith and unafraid;
And the peace I have through trusting
For the world I would not trade.

If I tried to follow Your wonderful way,
         G                       D       F#m
Then all of my life would be me and not You,
        Em                          A      D
And none of Your glory would ever shine through.

Take each new day, whatever’s in store,
Take my whole being and into me pour,
Your power and Your Spirit, oh make me anew;
For no one can change me, Lord Jesus, but You.

You can walk alone, you only need the Lord,

He’ll show you the way.

God never moves without purpose or plan
       C         Am           Dm          G
When trying His servant and moulding a man.
      C            Am               Dm             G
Give thanks to the Lord though your testing seems long;
    F           G        C
In darkness He giveth a song.

Chorus:
     C            Am      Dm           G
O rejoice in the Lord, He makes no mistake.
     C            Am         Dm         G
He knoweth the end of each path that I take.

For when I am tried and purified,
C              G       C
I shall come forth as gold.

I could not see through the shadows ahead;
So I looked at the cross of my Saviour instead.
I bowed to the will of the Master that day;
Then peace came and tears fled away.

Now I can see testing comes from above;
God strengthens His children and purges in love.
My Father knows best, and I trust in His care;
Through purging more fruit I will bear.

C7        F           Em Am               Dm            G7
For His very life He sacrificed, and He lives to intercede.

Chorus:

He is the Lord of lords, and when He speaks,
F              G     Em Am
Winds and waves obey.
         F      Dm         Em      Am
When Jesus whispers, “Peace, be still,”
       Dm                  G
Then darkness turns to day.
              C            Em
And as I’m trusting in my Saviour’s word
F              G        Em Am
Doubts and fears all cease.
           F              Em     Am
And beneath the shelter of His wings
       Dm       G7      C
I’m at rest in perfect peace.

I will seek for souls in darkness, Calv’ry’s love with them to share.
Empowered by His Spirit I will follow anywhere.
For I know whate’er befall me my Lord is in control.
And as my mind is stayed on him perfect peace He gives my
soul.

Jesus, Saviour, pilot me
C     G        D          G
Over life’s tempestuous sea;
D                            G
Unknown waves before me roll,
D                              G
Hiding rocks and treach’rous shoal;
G                      C         G
Chart and compass came from Thee:
C        G      D     G
Jesus, Saviour, pilot me.

As a mother stills her child,
Thou canst hush the ocean wild;
Boisterous waves obey Thy will
When Thou say’st to them, “Be still!”
Wondrous Sovereign of the sea,
Jesus, Saviour, pilot me.

When at last I near the shore,
And the fearful breakers roar
‘Twixt me and the peaceful rest,
Then, while leaning on Thy breast,
May I hear Thee say to me,
“Fear not, I will pilot thee.”

Whom have I, O Lord, beside You?
             D              G
What have I except Your love?
            Em             C
Where is home if not for heaven,
            A              D
There to dwell with You above?
            G             C
Who are You, if not my Savior?
                        B7
Who am I if not Your own?

What are You if not my shelter,
                               D
Christ, my Rock and Cornerstone?
          G                 D
Jesus, Saviour, blessed friend,
        A        D       G
I will love You without end.

Who will share my earthly sorrow?
Who will heal my broken heart?
Who will hold my life together
When it seems to fall apart?
When the fears are far too many,
And the joys are far too few,
Who will comfort and defend me?
Only You, Lord, only You.
Jesus, Savior, dearest friend
I will trust You without end.

Where, O Lord, when life is over,
Can I go, but home to You?
What have I except the promise
Where You are I shall be too?
When at last I reach the comfort
Of that bright celestial place,
There with joy will I behold You,
Gaze upon Your glorious face.
Jesus, Savior, heav’nly friend,
I will praise You without end.
I will praise You without end.

    G               C                G       D7      G
And He will surely give you rest by trusting in His Word.

Chorus:
G               C     G                         D
Only trust Him! Only trust Him! Only trust Him now!
G                 C        G                 D7       G
He will save you! He will save you! He will save you now!

For Jesus shed His precious blood rich blessings to bestow;
Plunge now into the crimson flood that washes white as snow.

Yes, Jesus is the Truth, the Way, that leads you into rest;
Believe in Him without delay, and you are fully blest.

Come, then, and join this holy band, and on to glory go,
To dwell in that celestial land, where joys immortal flow.

       G                   C           G
My soul in sad exile was out on life’s sea,
                               D
So burdened with sin and distressed,
         G            G7
Till I heard a sweet voice saying,
  C               G
Make me your choice,
                   D          G G7
And I entered the haven of rest.

Chorus:
      C                       G
I’ve anchored my soul in the haven of rest,
                            D
I’ll sail the wide seas no more;
       G               B7         C          G
The tempest may sweep over the wild, stormy deep;
                     D    G
In Jesus I’m safe evermore.

I yielded myself to His tender embrace,
And faith taking hold of the word,
My fetters fell off, and I anchored my soul;
The haven of rest is my Lord.

The song of my soul, since the Lord made me whole,
Has been the old story so blest,
Of Jesus, who’ll save whosoever will have
A home in the haven of rest.

O come to the Saviour, He patiently waits
To save by His power divine;
Come, anchor your soul in the haven of rest,
And say, My Belovèd is mine.

D               A     D     G                   D      A

D                G             D               A     D
Even when my faith is small, Trusting Jesus, that is all.

Chorus:
 D               A            F#      Bm       E       A
Trusting as the moments fly, Trusting as the days go by;
 D        A        D7    G D                   A7 D
Trusting Him whate’er befall, Trusting Jesus, that is all.

Brightly doth His Spirit shine, into this poor heart of mine;
While He leads I cannot fall, Trusting Jesus, that is all.

Singing if my way is clear, praying if the path be drear;
If in danger for Him call; Trusting Jesus, that is all.

Trusting Him while life shall last, Trusting Him till earth is past,
Till within the jasper wall, Trusting Jesus, that is all.

O how sweet the glorious message simple faith may claim;
G                            D      A      D
Yesterday, today, forever, Jesus is the same!
D                 G                 C       D         G
Still He loves to save the sinful, heal the sick and lame,
G                                          Am D         G
Cheer the mourner, calm the tempest - Glory to His name!

Chorus:
G             C             G            D
Yesterday, today, forever, Jesus is the same;
G                    C              G     D     G
All may change, but Jesus never - Glory to His Name!
G     D       G                 D
Glory to His Name, Glory to His Name;
G                    C             G     D      G
All may change, but Jesus never - Glory to His Name!

Him who pardoned erring Peter never need’st thou fear;
He who came to faithless Thomas all thy doubt will clear;
He who let the loved disciple on His bosom rest
Bids thee still, with love as tender, lean upon His breast.

He who ’mid the raging billows walked upon the sea
Still can hush our wildest tempest, as on Galilee;
He who wept and prayed in anguish in Gethsemane,
Drinks with us each cup of trembling, in our agony.

As of old He walked to Emmaus, with them to abide,
So through all life’s way He walketh, ever near our side;
Soon again shall we behold Him, hasten, Lord, the day!
But ’twill still be “this same Jesus,” as He went away.

And to my list’ning ears,
    D                  A        D
All nature sings, and round me rings
            A       D
The music of the spheres.
            A         D
This is my Father's world,
   G                D
I rest me in the thought
     D                    A       D
Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
               A          D
His hand the wonders wrought.

This is my Father's world,
The birds their carols raise;
The morning light, the lily white,
Declare their Maker's praise.
This is my Father's world,
He shines in all that's fair;
In the rustling grass I hear him pass,
He speaks to me everywhere.

This is my Father's world,
O let me ne'er forget
That though the wrong seems oft so strong,
God is the Ruler yet.
This is my Father's world,
The battle is not done,
Jesus who died shall be satisfied,
And earth and heav’n be one.

 E                          E7 A              B7      E
There by His love o’ershaded, sweetly my soul shall rest.
 B7                              F#                B7
Hark! ’tis the voice of angels, borne in a song to me
                    E    F#                B7
Over the fields of glory, over the jasper sea.

Chorus:
 E                                              B7
Safe in the arms of Jesus, safe on His gentle breast,
 E                        E7     A          B7        E
There by His love o’ershaded, sweetly my soul shall rest.

Safe in the arms of Jesus, safe from corroding care,
Safe from the world’s temptations, sin cannot harm me there.
Free from the blight of sorrow, free from my doubts and fears;
Only a few more trials, only a few more tears!

Jesus, my heart’s dear refuge, Jesus has died for me;
Firm on the Rock of Ages ever my trust shall be.
Here let me wait with patience, wait till the night is o'er;
Wait till I see the morning Break on the golden shore.

When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,
        G         D              A
What a glory He sheds on our way!
          D                       A            D
While we do His good will, He abides with us still,
         G              D       AD
And with all who will trust and o-bey.

Chorus:
 A         D               B7        Em
Trust and obey! For there’s no other way
       A       D                       A D
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and o-bey.

Not a shadow can rise, not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt nor a fear, not a sigh nor a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief nor a loss, not a frown nor a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove the delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favour He shows, and the joy He bestows,
Are for those who will trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at His feet,
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do, where He sends we will go;
Never fear, only trust and obey.

There shall be showers of blessing;

This is the promise of love;

There shall be seasons refreshing,
Em             A          D D7
Sent from the Saviour above.

Chorus:
G
Showers of blessing,
                         D
Showers of blessing we need:
 G             C          G
Mercy drops round us are falling,
 D           D7          G
But for the showers we plead.

There shall be showers of blessing;
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,
Sound of abundance of rain.

There shall be showers of blessing;
Send them upon us, O Lord;
Grant to us now a refreshing,
Come, and now honor Thy Word.

There shall be showers of blessing;
Oh, that today they might fall,
Now as to God we’re confessing,
Now as on Jesus we call!

Trust in the evening, trust in the night.

God cannot fail you, His way is best.
 E                       D          A
Learn how to trust whatever the test.

Chorus:
                    E            A
Trust in the Lord, lean on His Word.
              D          A     E       A
Trust in the Lord, lean wholly on His Word.

Trust Him in sorrow, trust Him in pain;
Trust Him when all of life seems in vain.
Though you are weary, follow Him still.
All He has promised He will fulfill.

Trust every moment, trust all the day;
Trust Him however dark seems the way.
Blessings abound, and still there is more.
Faith is the key that opens the door.

Take the name of Jesus with you,
 C                        G
Child of sorrow and of woe;

It will joy and comfort give you
 D                           G
Take it then, where'er you go.

Chorus:
          C               G
Precious name, O how sweet!
                           D
Hope of earth and joy of heav'n;
           G            C
Precious name, O how sweet!
         G         D      G
Hope of earth and joy of heav'n.

Take the name of Jesus ever,
As a shield from every snare;
If temptations round you gather,
Breathe that holy name in prayer.

O the precious name of Jesus!
How it thrills our souls with joy,
When His loving arms receive us,
And His songs our tongues employ!

At the name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostrate at His feet,
King of kings, in heav'n we'll crown Him,
When our journey is complete.

         G                                    G7
I must needs go home by the way of the cross,
          C                  G
There’s no other way but this;
         D                      G
I shall ne’er get sight of the gates of light
        D            A      D D7
If the way of the cross I miss.

Chorus:
       G
The way of the cross leads home,
       G
The way of the cross leads home;
        D                G      G7
It is sweet to know, as I onward go,
 C G                   D      G
The way of the cross leads home.

I must needs go on in the blood-sprinkled way,
The path that the Saviour trod,
If I ever climb to the heights sublime,
Where the soul is at home with God.

Then I bid farewell to the way of the world,
To walk in it nevermore;
For my Lord says, “Come,” and I seek my home,
Where He waits at the open door.

Some day the silver cord will break,

And I no more as now shall sing;
    D        A               D
But Oh, the joy when I shall wake
            G     A       D
Within the palace of the King!

Chorus:

And I shall see Him face to face,

And I shall see Him face to face,
      G               A        D
And tell the story Saved by grace.

Some day my earthly house will fall,
I cannot tell how soon ’twill be;
But this I know my All in All
Has now a place in heav’n for me.

Some day when fades the golden sun
Beneath the rosy tinted west,
My blessèd Lord will say, Well done!
And I shall enter into rest.

Some day till then I’ll watch and wait,
My lamp all trimmed and burning bright,
That when my Saviour opens the gate,
My soul to Him may take its flight.

Just to take Him at His Word,

Just to know, Thus saith the Lord.

How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er!
 G               C       G
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
       C         D        G
O for grace to trust Him more!

O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to trust His cleansing blood;
Just in simple faith to plunge me
‘Neath the healing, cleansing flood!

Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just from sin and self to cease;
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest, and joy and peace.

I’m so glad I learned to trust Thee,
Precious Jesus, Saviour, Friend;
And I know that Thou art with me,
Wilt be with me to the end.

We have not feared thee as we ought,
Nor bowed beneath thine awful eye,
Nor guarded deed, and word, and thought,
Remembering that God was nigh.
Lord, give us faith to know thee near,
And grant the grace of holy fear.

We have not loved thee as we ought,
Nor cared that we are loved by thee;
Thy presence we have coldly sought,
And feebly longed thy face to see.
Lord, give a pure and loving heart
To feel and own the love thou art.

We have not served thee as we ought;
Alas! the duties left undone,
The work with little fervour wrought,
The battles lost, or scarcely won!
Lord, give the zeal, and give the might,
For thee to toil, for thee to fight.

When shall we know thee as we ought,
And fear, and love, and serve aright!
When shall we, out of trial brought,
Be perfect in the land of light!
Lord, may we day by day prepare
To see thy face, and serve thee there.

Life Church Sunday School, that’s the place for me,
                     G
Every Lord’s Day, happy as can be.
                        C
Here I read the Bible, and I learn the Gospel,
G                D7                G
Here I worship Him who died for me.
C
Praise Him! Praise Him! Let us one and all
C7                        F
Spread the Good News whether big or small.
                               C
So let’s bring our friends and loved ones
                 F               G     C
To our Saviour, Jesus Christ of Calvary.

Jesus has a table spread
            C
Where the saints of God are fed,
       D                                     G
He invites His chosen people, “Come and dine”;
          G
With His manna He doth feed
          C
And supplies our every need:
        D                                G
O ’tis sweet to sup with Jesus all the time!

Chorus:
            C                                    G
“Come and dine,” the Master calleth, “Come and dine”;
         C              A             D
You may feast at Jesus’ table all the time;
         G                             Em       C
He Who fed the multitude, turned the water into wine,
       D                                 G
To the hungry calleth now, “Come and dine.”

The disciples came to land,
Thus obeying Christ’s command,
For the Master called unto them, “Come and dine”;
There they found their heart’s desire,
Bread and fish upon the fire;
Thus He satisfies the hungry every time.

Soon the Lamb will take His bride
To be ever at His side,
All the host of Heaven will assembled be;
O ’twill be a glorious sight,
All the saints in spotless white;
And with Jesus they will feast eternally.

Cheers each winding path I tread,
Gives me grace for every trial,
Feeds me with the living Bread.
Though my weary steps may falter
And my soul athirst may be,
Gushing from the Rock before me,
Lo! A spring of joy I see;
Gushing from the Rock before me,
Lo! A spring of joy I see.

All the way my Saviour leads me
O the fullness of His love!
Perfect rest to me is promised
In my Father’s house above.
When my spirit, clothed immortal,
Wings its flight to realms of day
This my song through endless ages:
Jesus led me all the way;
This my song through endless ages:
Jesus led me all the way.

There’s a Church in a garden by a greenwood
                           A     A7
No lovelier church I have known.
    D                      A
No place is so dear to our childhood
       E                           A
As the garden of fragrant pine and palm.

Chorus:

Oh, come, come, come, come,

Come to Life Church in the greenwood
                                     A   A7
Oh come to the church where we’ve grown.
    D                       A
No place is so dear to our childhood
       E                           A
As the garden of fragrant pine and palm.

How sweet on a bright Sunday morning,
To list to the big chiming bell.
Its tones so earnestly calling,
Oh come to church in the dell.

Let us go to the Church in yon greenwood,
By the bowers o’er Galilee Sea.
Where the sacred songs will be chanted,
There the Master bids us dine on the lea.

From the Church in a garden by a greenwood,
When day fades away into night.
I would fain from this haunt of my childhood,
Wing my way to the mansions of light.

But his delight by day and night
        C     Dm      G C
Is the Law of God almighty.

He is like a tree - a tree that flourishes,
Being planted by the water - blessed is that man.
He will bring forth fruit, his leaf will wither not
For in all he does he prospers - blessed is that man.
For his delight by day and night
Is the Law of God almighty.

The wicked are not so - for they are like the chaff
Which the wind blows clean away - the wicked are not so.
The wicked will not stand on the judgement day,
Nor belong to God's people - the wicked will not stand.
But God knows the way of righteous men
And ungodly ways will perish.

All the help that we give,
All the life we bestow.
As His children they're an offering we make,
Not expecting return,
Just a gift for His sake.

Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;
Though His hand may lead me over dreary ways,
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.

Anywhere with Jesus, over land and sea,
Telling souls in darkness of salvation free;
Ready as He summons me to go or stay,
Anywhere with Jesus when He points the way.

Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
When the dark’ning shadows round about me creep,
Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam;
Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.

Before our Father's throne
We pour our ardent pray'rs;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims, are one,
Our comforts and our cares.

We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

When we asunder part,
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again.

                        A               B7            E
Of wondrous grace that brought me back to His fold again-
    A                     E        E7               A
Of heights and depths of mercy far deeper than the sea

And higher than the heavens, my theme shall ever be.

Chorus (4/4):

Sweeter as the years go by,
  E                        A
Sweeter as the years go by;
                        D
Richer, fuller, deeper, Jesus’ love is sweeter,
   A               E       A
Sweeter as the years go by.

He trod in old Judea life’s pathway long ago-
The people thronged about Him His saving grace to know;
He healed the brokenhearted, and caused the blind to see;
And still His great heart yearneth in love for even me.

’Twas wondrous love which led Him for us to suffer loss-
To bear without a murmur the anguish of the cross;
With saints redeemed in glory let us our voices raise,
Till heav’n and earth re-echo with our Redeemer’s praise.

In whom no darkness is.

Walk in the light! and thou shalt own
Thy darkness passed away,
Because that light hath on thee shone
In which is perfect day.

Walk in the light! and e'en the tomb
No fearful shade shall wear;
Glory shall chase away its gloom,
For Christ hath conquered there.

Walk in the light! thy path shall be
A path, though thorny, bright;
For God, by grace, shall dwell in thee,
And God Himself is light.

Still, still with Thee- when purple morning breaketh,
Gm                 Dm     G                C
When the bird waketh and the shadows flee;
C               Am                   F
Fairer than morning, lovelier than daylight,
Gm                    Dm        G              C
Dawns the sweet consciousness- I am with Thee!

Alone with Thee amid the mystic shadows-
The solemn hush of nature newly born;
Alone with Thee in breathless adoration,
In the calm dew and freshness of the morn!

Still, still with Thee- as to each newborn morning
A fresh and solemn splendor still is giv’n,
So does this blessèd consciousness, awaking,
Breathe each day nearness unto Thee and heav’n!

When sinks the soul, subdued by toil, to slumber,
Its closing eyes look up to Thee in prayer;
Sweet the repose beneath Thy wings o’ershading,
But sweeter still to wake and find Thee there!

So shall it be at last in that bright morning,
When the soul waketh and life’s shadows flee;
O in that hour, fairer than daylight dawning,
Shall rise the glorious thought- I am with Thee!

A sunbeam, a sunbeam,
                       E
I’ll be a sunbeam for Him.

Jesus wants me to be loving,
And kind to all I see;
Showing how pleasant and happy
His little one can be.

I will ask Jesus to help me
To keep my heart from sin,
Ever reflecting His goodness,
And always shine for Him.

I’ll be a sunbeam for Jesus;
I can if I but try;
Serving Him moment by moment,
Then live with Him on high.

To the faults of those around me;

Let me praise a little more.
           E                A

Be a little bit more cheery;

Think a little more of others
       B7            E
And a little less of me.

Let me be a little braver
When temptation bids me waver;
Let me strive a little harder
To be all that I should be.
Let me be a little meeker
With a brother who is weaker;
Let me think more of my neighbour
And a little less of me.

It’s not an easy road we are travelling to heaven,

But Jesus walks beside me and brightens the journey,
                     G7     C
And lightens every heavy load.

It’s not an easy road – there are trials and troubles,
And many are the dangers we meet;
But Jesus guards and keeps so that nothing can harm us,
And smooths the rugged path for our feet.

Though I am often footsore and weary from travel,
Though I am often bowed down with care,
A better day is coming when home in the glory,
We’ll rest in perfect peace over there.

Of my pride, of the world so bright.
Sometimes, chains of tempatations assail,
My sinfulness I see so real.

Then look up, step steadfastly on
When the storms of life trouble you;
Look beyond, constantly follow My hand -
I am slowly moulding a man.

Then, my child, in your faith be strong,
Follow not the path of erring throngs,
I am, child, constantly making you wise,
Press on and you shall see the prize.

Chorus for last stanza:
We shall mount up with wings as the eagles up above
We shall run, we shall not be weary, fainting not
We shall walk, by Thy strength we will stand forever more,
By Thy grace we will stand.

With God's whole armour, clean and bright
The panoply that's ours to wear,
Designed to make us stand and bear
Till Satan's evil day is past
And we shall stand with Christ, at last.

Come, let us take the Truth of God
And girded with His Holy Word
The armour must be held in place
Secure and safe in Truth's Embrace;
Then take the breastplate God imparts:
The righteousness which keeps our hearts.

Come, let our feet be firm and sure
By putting on the Gospel pure
That brings the peace we need, to live --
The peace that only Christ can give;
And quench the fiery darts of Hell
By using faith to shield us well.

Come, take the helmet and the sword
To win the battles of the Lord:
Salvation's hope, our fight to press
Despite our mindful weariness;
The Word of God, our means shall be
To swift and blessed victory.

Come, let us in the Spirit pray
To keep our armour bright each day,
And let us watch for every saint
That none should ever fall or faint,
But boldly braving every test
Till we find our eternal rest.

And show them God’s mercies forever endure.
Inspite of our past our Lord uses us still,
And works it for good in the course of His will.

Thou hast made us willing,
Thou hast made us free.

Fierce may be the conflict,
Strong may be the foe,
But the King’s own army
None can overthrow;
Round His standard ranging,
Vict’ry is secure,
For His truth unchanging
Makes the triumph sure.

Resting in my Savior as my all in all,

Stand up, stand up for Jesus, the trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict, in this His glorious day;
Ye that are men now serve Him against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger, and strength to strength oppose.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus, stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you, ye dare not trust your own;
Put on the gospel armor, each piece put on with prayer;
Where duty calls or danger, be never wanting there.

Stand up, stand up for Jesus, the strife will not be long;
This day the noise of battle, the next, the victor’s song;
To him who overcometh, a crown of life shall be;
He with the King of Glory shall reign eternally.

To eyes made blind because they will not see,
To spend, though it be blood, to spend and spare not,
So send I you to taste of Calvary.

Make the glorious tidings known;
Of the crimson banner now the story tell,
While the Lord shall claim His own!

When the glory dawns- ’tis drawing very near-
It is hastening day by day-
Then before our King the foe shall disappear,
And the cross the world shall sway!

To preach the Word with passion and give ourselves to prayer.

Stand alone     to share His suff’rings and for thy faith contend.

Stand alone with great compassion and true humility;
Preach the Word with pow’r and meekness for peace and purity.
Let love for Christ constrain thee to keep thy conscience clear.
Stand alone in circumspection with rev’rent, godly fear.

Stand alone and by ye sep’rate His name to sanctify,
Unashamed to spread the gospel and hold His standard high.
Without the camp now seek Him thy Lord’s reproach to bear.
Stand alone and in the Spirit be watchful unto prayer.

Stand alone and be ye holy and thou shalt see thy Lord,
And rejoice in tribulation for great is thy reward.
Possess thy soul with patience; endure unto the end.
Stand alone and be courageous; thy God shall be thy friend.

Stand alone for God hath promised to stand with all who do,
And to save His hand is mighty with many or with few.
Hold fast the ancient landmarks of battles fought and won.
Stand alone to death be faithful, and God shall say, “Well done!”

With the cross of Jesus going on before.

At the name of Jesus, Satan’s host doth flee;
On then, Christian soldiers, on to victory!
Hell’s foundations quiver at the shout of praise:
Brothers, lift your voices, loud your anthems raise!

Like a mighty army moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod.
We are not divided, all one body we –
One in hope and doctrine, one in charity.

Crowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never ‘gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ’s own promise, and that cannot fail.

Onward, then, ye people, join our happy throng,
Blend with ours your voices in the triumph song;
Glory, laud, and honour unto Christ the King;
This through countless ages men and angels sing.

My course is set, my God designed it all for His great cause.
I will not live for selfish gain
Or die for man’s applause.

Every blessed Word I’ll cling.
To Him, His every wish I’ll bring, till Jesus calls me home.

Courage almost gone!

See the glorious banner waving!

Over every foe!

Fierce and long the battle rages,
But our help is near:
Onward comes our great Commander,
Cheer, my comrades, cheer!

Is born, of David's line,
A Saviour, who is Christ the Lord;
And this shall be the sign:

"The heav'nly Babe you there shall find
To human view displayed,
All meanly wrapped in swaddling bands,
And in a manger laid.
And in a manger laid."

Thus spake the seraph, and forthwith
Appeared a shining throng
Of angels praising God, and thus
Addressed their joyful song:
Addressed their joyful song:

"All glory be to God on high,
And to the earth be peace:
Goodwill henceforth from heav'n to men
Begin and never cease.
Begin and never cease."

Come peasant, king to own Him;
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

By Thine all sufficient merit,
Raise us to Thy glorious throne.

         G                G7
On the night Christ was born
         C
Just before break of morn,
         D                       G
As the stars in the sky were fading,
          G               G7
O’er the place where He lay,
       C                  Am
Fell a shadow cold and gray
      G                 D         G
Of a cross that would humble a King.

Chorus:
        G7       C
Born to die upon Calv'ry,
       G           A         C D7
Jesus suffered my sin to forgive;
G       G7       C
Born to die upon Calv'ry,
          G          D         G
He was wounded that I might live.

Jesus knew when He came
He would suffer in shame;
He could feel every pain and sorrow.
But He left Paradise,
With His blood He paid the price
My redemption to Jesus I owe.

From His throne Jesus came,
Laid aside heaven’s fame
In exchange for the cross of Calv’ry;
For my gain suffered loss,
For my sin He bore the cross
He was wounded and I was set free.

Dearest Lord, ever more
May Thy cross I adore
As I follow the path to Calv’ry;
Of Thy death I partake,
My ambition I forsake
All my will I surrender to Thee.

Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?

Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ Whose birth the angels sing;
Come, adore on bended knee,
Christ the Lord, the newborn King.

See Him in a manger laid,
Whom the choirs of angels praise;
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,
While our hearts in love we raise.

The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head;

The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay,

The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay.

The cattle are lowing, the Baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes;
I love Thee, Lord Jesus! Look down from the sky,
And stay by my cradle till morning is nigh.

Be near me, Lord Jesus! I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever, and love me, I pray;
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care,
And fit us for heaven, to live with thee there.

What condescension,
Bringing us redemption;
That in the dead of night,
Not one faint hope in sight,
God, gracious, tender,
Laid aside His splendor,
He gave himself, to win, to save my soul.

Without reluctance,
Flesh and blood His substance
He took the form of man,
Revealed the hidden plan.
O glorious myst’ry,
Sacrifice of Calv’ry,
And now I know Thou art the great “I AM.”

The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wond’ring
love.
O morning stars, together proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King, and peace to men on earth.

How silently, how silently, the wondrous gift is giv’n!
So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of His heav’n.
No ear may hear His coming, but in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him still, the dear Christ enters in.

O holy Child of Bethlehem! Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin, and enter in; be born in us today.
We hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tell;
O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Emmanuel.

With humble hearts we bow in adoration
Before this Child, gift of God’s matchless love,
Sent from on high to purchase our salvation –
That we might dwell with Him ever above.
What grace untold – to leave the bliss of glory
And die for sinners guilty and forlorn:
Fall on your knees! Repeat the wondrous story!
O night divine – O night when Christ was born!
O night divine – O night, O night divine!

O day of joy, when in eternal splendour
He shall return in His glory to reign,
When every tongue due praise to Him shall render,
His pow’r and might to all nations proclaim!

A thrill of hope our longing hearts rejoices,
For soon shall dawn that glad eternal morn:
Fall on your knees! With joy lift up your voices!
O night divine – O night when Christ was born!
O night divine – O night, O night divine!

When darkness lay upon this earth, a glorious light did shine;
God sent a Gift of priceless worth and showed His love divine.

Now to the manger let us go, to worship and adore;
The tender Babe upon the straw, our Savior evermore.

How wonderful that God’s own Son, should so Himself abase!
He thrust the mighty from their throne, and gave the lowly grace.

Once in royal David’s city
C#m G#m B7             E
Stood a lowly cattle shed,
B7        E       B7        E
Where a mother laid her Baby,
C#m G#m        B7        E
In a manger for His bed;
A    E         B7        E
Mary was that mother mild,
A       E        B7       E
Jesus Christ her little Child.

He came down to earth from heaven,
Who is God and Lord of all,
And His shelter was a stable,
And his cradle was a stall;
With the lowly, poor, and mean,
Lived on earth our Savior then.

And, through all His wondrous childhood,
He would honour and obey,
Love and watch the lowly maiden
In whose gentle arms He lay.
Christian children all must be
Mild, obedient, good as He.

Not in that poor lowly stable,
With the oxen standing by,
We shall see Him; but in heaven,
Set at God’s right hand on high;
When like stars His children crowned
All in white shall wait around.

Good Christian men, rejoice

To gain His everlasting hall:

Joy to the earth! The Saviour reigns;
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains,
Repeat the sounding joy, repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found, far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as the curse is found.

He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love, and wonders of His love,
And wonders, wonders of His love.

Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth.
Hark! The herald angels sing,

Come, Desire of nations, come!
Fix in us Thy humble home:
Rise, the woman’s conq’ring seed,
Bruise in us the serpent’s head.

Stamp Thine image in its place:
Second Adam from above,
Reinstate us in Thy love.

Each one receiving justly his due;

O loving kindness, faithful and true!
FInd peace and shelter under the blood,

Can give me peace within.

Not what I feel or do,
Can give me peace, O God;
Not all my prayers, or sighs, or tears,
Can ease my awful load.

Thy love to me, O God,
Not mine, O Lord, to Thee
Can rid me of this dark unrest,
And set my spirit free.

No other work save Thine,
No meaner blood, will do;
No strength, save that which is divine,
Can bear me safely through.

I praise the God of grace,
I trust His love and might;
He calls me His, I call Him mine;
My God, my joy, my light!

Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

For my cleansing this I see –
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
For my pardon this my plea –
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Nothing can for sin atone –
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
Naught of good that I have done –
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

This is all my hope and peace –
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
This is all my righteousness –
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Now by this I’ll overcome –
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
Now by this I’ll reach my home –
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

His Word will not fail us we know.

“All things are possible”, this is His Word.
Receive it, ’tis written for you.
Believe in His promises, God cannot fail;
For what He has said He will do.

Creator of all things, with infinite pow’r,
He spoke - they appeared by His mouth.
Impossible things are not known unto Him.
He made us, He ruleth the earth.

When the Bridegroom cometh will your robes be white?
Pure and white in the blood of the Lamb?
Will your soul be ready for the mansions bright,
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb?

Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin,
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb;
There’s a fountain flowing for the soul unclean,
O be washed in the blood of the Lamb!

Thorny was the crown that He wore,
And the cross His body o’ercame;
Grievous were the sorrows He bore,
But He suffered Thus not in vain.
May I to that fountain be led,
Made to cleanse my sins here below;
Wash me in the blood that He shed,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

Father, I have wandered from Thee,
Often has my heart gone astray;
Crimson do my sins seem to me—
Water cannot wash them away.
Jesus, to the fountain of Thine,
Leaning on Thy promise, I go;
Cleanse me by Thy washing divine,
And I shall be whiter than snow.

To Calv’ry’s hill one day,
The Lord was led away,
None else the price could pay,
For all my sin;
He on the cross was slain,
Yielding His life in pain;
He felt the bitter stain,
Of all my sin.

Was ever love so strong?
Was ever crime so wrong?
When Jesus suffered long,
For all my sin;
He saw my greatest need,
Became my friend indeed,
Thru Him I have been freed,
Of all my sin.

Take all my will, my passion, self and pride;
I now surrender, Lord-- in me abide.

O Holy Ghost, revival comes from Thee;
Send a revival, start the work in me;
Thy Word declares Thou wilt supply our need;
For blessings now, O Lord, I humbly plead.

Give me a passion for souls, dear Lord,
  G                   C
A passion to save the lost;
                         F
O that Thy love were by all adored,
     D                 G
And welcomed at any cost.

Jesus, I long, I long to be winning,
G                                   C
Men who are lost, and constantly sinning;
F                     D
O may this hour be one of beginning,
    G                    C
The story of pardon to tell.

Though there are dangers untold and stern,
Confronting me in the way,
Willingly still would I go, nor turn,
But trust Thee for grace each day.

How shall this passion for souls be mine?
Lord, make Thou the answer clear;
Help me to throw out the old Life-Line,
To those who are struggling near.

By faith, for my cleansing I see Thy blood flow
Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.

Ye children of men, attend to the word
So solemnly uttered by Jesus the Lord;
And let not this message to you be in vain,
“Ye must be born again”

O ye who would enter that glorious rest
And sing with the ransomed the song of the blest;
The life everlasting if ye would obtain,
“Ye must be born again.”

A dear one in heaven thy heart yearns to see,
At the beautiful gate may be watching for thee;
Then list to the note of this solemn refrain,
“Ye must be born again.”

Can sever me from Thee!

My heart in joy upleapeth –
Grief cannot linger there!

The Sun that shines upon me

Burdened soul, is your heart growing weary
With the toil and the heat of the day;
Does it seem that your path is more thorny,
As you journey along on life’s way ?
Go away and in secret before him
Tell your grief to the Saviour alone;
He will lighten your care, for He still answers prayer,
God is still on the throne.

You may live in a tent or a cottage,
Unnoticed by those who pass by;
But a mansion for you He is building
In that beautiful city on high;
It will outshine the wealth and the splendor
Of the richest on earth we have known;
He’s the Architect true, and He’s building for you;
God is still on the throne.

He is coming again, is the promise
To disciples when He went away;
In like manner as He has gone from you,
You will see Him returning some day;
Does His tarrying cause you to wonder,
Does it seem He’s forgotten His own?
His promise is true, He is coming for you;
God is still on the throne.

No tongue can bid me thence depart.

When Satan tempts me to despair
And tells me of the guilt within,
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end to all my sin.
Because the sinless Saviour died
My sinful soul is counted free.
For God the Just is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me.

Behold Him there the risen Lamb,
My perfect spotless righteousness,
The great unchangeable I Am,
The King of glory and of grace.
One with Himself I cannot die,
My soul is purchased by His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high
With Christ my Saviour and my God!

God be with you till we meet again

God be with you till me meet again
‘Neath His wings protecting hide you,
Daily manna still provide you -
God be with you till we meet again.

God be with you till me meet again
When life’s perils thick confound you,
Put His arms unfailing round you -
God be with you till we meet again.

God be with you till me meet again
Keep love’s banner floating o’er you,
Smite death’s threat’ning wave before you -
God be with you till we meet again.

D                    A
In sin I wandered, seeking a song.
Bm                      F#7
Days were so dreary, nights were so long.
Bm          F#       Bm
One day believing, Jesus receiving,
A         E              A A7
My soul thrilled with a song.

Chorus:
         D              A        D     G
Jesus gives me a song as I travel along
    D               B7         Em A
On life’s luring, lonesome road;
                                  D
I can sing as I go for there’s one thing I know,
           A           E     A A7
That will lift life’s heavy load;
              D               A         D        G
When the shadows are long, He will give me a song
            D           B7        Em A7
As when skies are blue and bright;
             D            C#        D         B7
For each step of the way, each hour of the day,
      Em               A        D
And songs in the deepest night.

Songs in the day time, songs in the night
Songs of devotion, songs of delight
Melodies ringing, in my heart singing
Jesus gives me a song.

Are you in trouble, are you distressed
Is there no singing, all is unrest
Look up to Jesus, He died to free us
He will give you a song.

He’s my comfort and my stay;
            D
From His tender love and mercy
                     G
I will never, never stray;
                     D         G
O’er the mountain rough and steep,
                               C
Through the valley dark and deep;
        D
Till I reach my home in glory,
                         G
He’ll go with me all the way.

A wonderful Saviour to me;
   C          C7           F
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
       C         G          C
Where rivers of pleasure I see.

Chorus:

He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
     G7                       C
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
             C7           F
He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
     C          G7               C
And covers me there with His hand,
 F C            G7              C
And covers me there with His hand.

A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away;
He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,
He giveth me strength as my day.

With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,
And, filled with His fullness divine,
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God
For such a Redeemer as mine!

When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,
I’ll shout with the millions on high.

“Who is this Jesus you talk about everyday?”

Since Christ my soul from sin set free,

This world has Heav’n been to me;

‘Tis Heav’n to know my sins forgiv’n;
            G         C
On land or sea, what matters where?
              G      D       G
Where Jesus is, ‘tis Heaven there.

Once Heaven seemed a far off place,
Till Jesus showed His smiling face;
Now it’s begun within my soul,
‘Twill last while endless ages roll

What matters where on earth we dwell?
On mountain top, or in the dell,
In cottage, or a mansion fair,
Where Jesus is, ‘tis Heav’n there.

You’re my heart’s lone desire, You’re all I need.

By wanting more, I’ve wanted less than all You’ve given me.
You gave your all by laying down your life on Calvary.
So I surrender all, Lord, my best to You I give,
And thank you now for giving me a reason to live.

He maketh me down to lie

Where living waters flow.

My soul crieth out : “Restore me again,
And give me the strength to take
The narrow path of righteousness,
E’en for His own name’s sake.”

Yea, though I should walk the valley of death,
Yet why should I fear from ill?
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still.

I waited for the Lord my God,
                   D
And patiently did bear;
     G        C       G
At length to me He did incline,
                D7    G
My voice and cry to hear.

He took me from a fearful pit
And from the miry clay,
And on a rock He set my feet,
Establishing my way.

He put a new song in my mouth,
Our God to magnify;
Many shall see it, and shall fear,
And on the Lord rely.

O blessed is the man whose trust
Upon the Lord relies,
Respecting not the proud, nor such
As turn aside to lies.

O Lord my God, full many are
The wonders Thou hast done;
Thy gracious thoughts to us-ward far
Above all thoughts are gone.

Thy tender mercies, Lord, from me
O do Thou not restrain;
Thy loving-kindness, and Thy truth,
Let them me still maintain.

Through foreign lands, God walked beside His own.

Chorus:

I’ll never leave you, never forsake you.

But when I break you, so that My name be glorified,
            Em       A7               D
I’ll never leave you, never forsake you.

Though fires and floods would seem to hide His plan for you,
Though trials and afflictions seem to take away your song,
Though you may never understand, just trust in His upholding
hand.
In time you’ll learn, He’s been there all along.

Leaning, leaning, leaning on the everlasting arms.

O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,
Leaning on the everlasting arms!
O how bright the path grows from day to day,
Leaning on the everlasting arms!

What have I to dread, what have I to fear,
Leaning on the everlasting arms!
I have blessed peace with my Lord so near,
Leaning on the everlasting arms.

Whether trials come or cease, keep me always on my knees.

Oh how can I untrusting be, when You are very near to me?

So enchained my spirit’s vision,
Looking at the Crucified.
All for Jesus! All for Jesus!
Looking at the Crucified;
All for Jesus! All for Jesus!
Looking at the Crucified.

Oh, what wonder! How amazing!
Jesus, glorious King of kings,
Deigns to call me His beloved,
Lets me rest beneath His wings.
All for Jesus ! All for Jesus !
Resting now beneath His wings;
All for Jesus ! All for Jesus !
Resting now beneath His wings.

To forgive the souls who wrong you, Who would make your
striving vain?

Are ye able to remember, When a thief lifts up his eyes,
That his pardoned soul is worthy Of a place in paradise?

Are ye able when the shadows Close around you with the sod,
To believe that spirit triumphs, To commend your soul to God?

Are ye able? Still the Master Whispers down eternity,
And heroic spirits answer, Now as then in Galilee.

Thou my everlasting portion,

Not for ease or worldly pleasure,

Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

Lead me thru the vale of shadows,
Bear me o’er life’s fitful sea;
Then the gate of life eternal
May I enter, Lord, with Thee.
Close to Thee, close to Thee,
Close to Thee, close to Thee;
Then the gate of life eternal
May I enter, Lord, with Thee.

I came to the Lord with my heart full of sin,

Empty of purpose and troubled within.

I cried to the Saviour, “Forgive me, I pray.”
He granted cleansing and sins fell away.
My bondage was ended, my heart was set free;
Lord, nevermore may I wander from Thee.

The wise may bring their learning,

And some bring strength and health;

We, too, would bring our treasures

To offer to the King;

We have no wealth or learning;
       A        B7       E
What shall we children bring?

We’ll bring Him hearts that love Him;
We’ll bring Him thankful praise,
And young souls meekly striving
To walk in holy ways;
And these shall be the treasures
We offer to the King,
And these are gifts that even
The poorest child may bring.

We’ll bring the little duties
We have to do each day;
We’ll try our best to please Him,
At home, at school, at play;
And better are these treasures
To offer to our King;
Than richest gifts without them—
Yet these a child may bring.

Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

Take my hands and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love;
Take my feet and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee,
Swift and beautiful for Thee.

Take my voice and let me sing
Always, only for my King;
Take my lips and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee,
Filled with messages from Thee.

Take my silver and my gold,
Not a mite would I withhold:
Take my intellect and use
Every pow’r as Thou shalt choose,
Every pow’r as Thou shalt choose.

Take my will and make it Thine;
It shall be no longer mine:
Take my heart, it is Thine own;
It shall be Thy royal throne,
It shall be Thy royal throne.

Take my love, my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure store:
Take myself and I will be
Ever, only, all for Thee,
Ever, only, all for Thee.

Give us the mind of Christ each passing day;

Teach us to know the truth that sets us free;

Grant us in all our thoughts to honour Thee.

Take Thou our hearts, O Christ, they are Thine own;
Come Thou within our souls and claim Thy throne;
Help us to shed abroad Thy deathless love;
Use us to make the earth like heav’n above.

Take Thou our wills, Most High! Hold Thou full sway;
Have in our inmost souls Thy perfect way;
Guard Thou each sacred hour from selfish ease;
Guide Thou our ordered lives as Thou dost please.

Take Thou ourselves, O Lord, heart, mind, and will;
Through our surrendered souls Thy plans fulfill.
We yield ourselves to Thee time, talents, all;
We hear, and henceforth heed, Thy sovereign call.

Vain are all terrestrial pleasures,

Mixed with dross the purest gold:
           G                   C
Seek we, then, for heav’nly treasures,
            G      D        G
Treasures never waxing old.
                          D
Let our best affections centre
                              B7
On the things around the throne:
           C
There no thief can ever enter;
           G          D        G
Moth and rust are there unknown.

Earthly joys no longer please us;
Here would we renounce them all;
Seek our only rest in Jesus,
Him our Lord and Master call.
Faith, our languid spirits cheering,
Points to brighter worlds above;
Bids us look for His appearing;
Bids us triumph in His love.

May our light be always burning,
And our loins be girded round,
Waiting for our Lord’s returning,
Longing for the welcome sound.
Thus the Christian life adorning,
Never need we be afraid,
Should He come at night or morning
Early dawn, or evening shade.

The things that I love and hold dear to my heart

They are borrowed, they're not mine at all

Jesus only let me use them to brighten my life
      Em            A             D D7
So remind me, remind me dear Lord.

Chorus:

Roll back the curtain of memory now and then,
 G
Show me where You've brought me from
      D                     A
And where I should have been;
     D          D7           G        D
Remember, I'm human and humans forget
      Em            A            D
So remind me, remind me dear Lord.

Nothing good have I done to deserve God's own Son,
I'm not worthy of the scars in His hands;
Yet he chose the road to Calvary to die in my stead
Why He loved me, I can't understand.

I guess it all comes down to where your heart is,
      C                       Am            Dm G7
It’s there your thoughts and feelings all begin;
      C            C7                F      Fm
But if you never give your heart to Jesus,
        C           Dm     G7       C
You’ll never really have a part in Him.

         Em              Am
If your treasures are in heaven,
              Am
Then your heart will be there too,
           F                 G7                   C
And the things you say and do will show Christ’s love;
             Em                Am
But if your treasures’ here on earth,
          Am
Tell me where your heart will be,
       F                              G G7
You’ll never have a part in things above.

If your mind’s set on the Spirit,
And you’re walking in God’s light
Then the watching world will see Christ’s love in you
But if your mind’s set on the earth
And the earthly things you do,
In poverty you’ll live your whole life through.

All its joys are but a name;

But His love abideth ever,
                             E
Through eternal years the same.

Chorus:

Oh, the height and depth of mercy!
         F#                     B7
Oh, the length and breadth of love!
         E             B7
Oh, the fullness of redemption,
                         E
Pledge of endless life above!

Take the world, but give me Jesus!
Sweetest comfort of my soul;
With my Saviour watching o’er me,
I can sing though billows roll.

Take the world, but give me Jesus!
Let me view His constant smile;
Then throughout my pilgrim journey
Light will cheer me all the while.

Take the world, but give me Jesus!
In His cross my trust shall be,
Till, with clearer, brighter vision,
Face to face my Lord I see.

My heart can sing when I pause to remember
                                       G D
A heartache here is but a stepping stone
          G           G7            C
Along a trail that's winding always upward,
                G       D             G
This troubled world is not my final home.

Chorus:
          Am        D7              G
But until then my heart will go on singing,
      Am        D7              G D
Until then with joy I'll carry on-
           G        G7              C C7
Until the day my eyes behold the city,
           G         D         G
Until the day God calls me home.

The things of earth will dim and lose their value
If we recall they're borrowed for awhile;
And things of earth that cause the heart to tremble,
Remembered there will only bring a smile.

This weary world with all its toil and struggle
May take its toll of misery and strife;
The soul of man is like a waiting falcon;
When it's released, it's destined for the skies.

Give heart and soul and mind and strength

To serve the King of kings.

Rise up, O men of God!
The kingdom tarries long;
Bring in the day of brotherhood
And end the night of wrong.

Rise up, O men of God!
The church for you doth wait,
Her strength unequal to her task;
Rise up and make her great!

Lift high the cross of Christ!
Tread where His feet have trod;
As brothers of the Son of Man,
Rise up, O men of God!

Let Thy precious blood applied,

May Thy tender love to me
         C      G       D        G
Bind me closer, closer, Lord to Thee.

Through this changing world below,
Lead me gently, gently as I go;
Trusting Thee, I cannot stray,
I can never, never lose my way.

Let me love Thee more and more,
Till this fleeting, fleeting life is o’er;
Till my soul is lost in love,
In a brighter, brighter world above.

Thee will I love with all my pow’r,

I love Thy Name, and Thine alone;
 Am          Gm        C7          F
Thee will I love, till Holy Ghost fire
             C          F     C
Fill all my soul with pure desire.

In darkness foolishly I strayed,
I sought Thee, yet from Thee I roved;
Too long my selfish thoughts obeyed
Thy creature more than Thee I loved;
But now Thy truth at last I see,
’Tis by Thy light it leadeth me.

I thank Thee, O Thou Righteous Sun,
For Thy bright beams on me have shined;
Thou hast the Tempter overthrown
My woes, removed and healed my mind;
I thank Thee for Thy quick'ning voice
Bids my poor heart in Thee rejoice.

Thee will I love, my joy, my crown,
Thee I adore my Lord, my God;
Thee will I love beneath Thy frown
I see Thy smile Thy shepherd's rod;
Let good and kindred pass away;
With Thee I'll dwell in endless day!

Give me, Lord, a servant’s heart.
Em                A7          G   D
Give me, Lord, a servant’s heart.

Make me a witness like You, dear Lord,
Showing the love of the cross,
Sharing your Word till all have heard,
Serving whatever the cost.

They call me old-fashioned because I believe
                   A7           D
That the Bible is God’s holy Word,
       G            D            D7      G
That Jesus, who lived among men long ago,
                     D7       G
Is divine, and the Christ of God.

Chorus:
    G
My sin was old-fashioned,
     D7
My guilt was old-fashioned,
        G            A7          D
God’s love was old-fashioned, I know;
          G          D            D7           G
And the way I was saved was the old-fashioned way,
                              D7          G
Through the blood that makes whiter than snow.

Old-fashioned, because I believe and accept
Only what has been spoken from heav’n;
Old-fashioned because at the cross I was saved,
At the cross had my sins forgiv’n.

Old-fashioned, because I am bound to do right,
To walk in the straight narrow way;
Because I have given my whole life to God,
Old-fashioned, because I pray.

Old-fashioned, because I am looking above
To Jesus, my glorified Lord;
Because I believe He is coming again,
Fulfilling His holy Word.

A workman that needeth not to be ashamed,

Rightly dividing, rightly dividing,
F         C Am        G7         C
Rightly dividing the Word of Truth.

For to whom much has been given Much more shall be required.

To seek the lost and hungry And feed them with His Word,
To reach out to our enemies, And embrace them with His love,
Empowered and commissioned, So we must do as He desires.
For to whom much has been given Much more shall be required.

Every part is Thine to use, Lord,
Thy living sacrifice be.

I want to learn to speak to Him,
To pray to Him, confess my sin,
To open my life and let Him in,
For joy will then be mine.

I want to learn to speak of Him;
My life must show that He lives in me,
My deeds, my thoughts, my words must speak
All of His love for me.

I want to learn to read His Word
For this is how I know the way,
To live my life as pleases Him
In holiness and joy.

O Holy Spirit of the Lord,
Enter now into this heart of mine;
Take full control of my selfish will
And make it wholly Thine.

Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,

To Thy precious, bleeding side.

Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,
By the pow’r of grace divine;
Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope
And my will be lost in Thine.

O the pure delight of a single hour
That before Thy throne I spend,
When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend.

There are depths of love that I cannot know
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy that I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with Thee.

Jesus, greatest, highest, I will come to Thee.

I am resolved to go to the Saviour,
Leaving my sin and strife;
He is the True One, He is the Just One,
He hath the words of life.

I am resolved to follow the Saviour,
Faithful and true each day;
Heed what He saith, do what He willeth,
He is the living way.

I am resolved to enter the kingdom,
Leaving the paths of sin;
Friends may oppose me, foes may beset me,
Still will I enter in.

Let Him have His way with thee.

Chorus:

His pow’r can make you what you ought to be,

His blood can cleanse your heart and make you free,

His love can fill your soul, and you will see
        G                         D7         G
’Twas best for Him to have His way with thee.

Would you have Him make you free, and follow at His call?
Would you know the peace that comes by giving all?
Would you have Him save you, so that you can never fall?
Let Him have His way with thee.

Would you in His kingdom find a place of constant rest?
Would you prove Him true in providential test?
Would you in His service labor always at your best?
Let Him have His way with thee.

I’m pressing on the upward way,
                    E           B7
New heights I’m gaining every day;
              E              A
Still praying as I’m onward bound,
                  E     B7      E
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

Chorus:

Lord, lift me up and let me stand
                            E
By faith on heaven’s table land;
            E7                A
A higher plane than I have found,
                 E       B7      E
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Though some may dwell where these abound,
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

I want to live above the world,
Though Satan’s darts at me are hurled;
For faith has caught the joyful sound,
The song of saints on higher ground.

I want to scale the utmost height,
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I’ll pray till heav’n I’ve found,
Lord, lead me on to higher ground.

Thou art the Potter; I am the clay:

Mould me and make me after Thy will,
             D         A          D
While I am waiting, yielded and still.

Have Thine own way, Lord, Have Thine own way;
Search me and try me, Master, today.
Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,
As in Thy presence humbly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord, Have Thine own way;
Wounded and weary, help me, I pray.
Power, all power, surely is Thine;
Touch me and heal me, Saviour Divine.

Have Thine own way, Lord, Have Thine own way;
Hold o’er my being absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit till all shall see
Christ only, always, living in me.

223 (4/4 Emaj)

   E               A                 E
I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus,

Who died upon the cruel tree?
     E                A            E
To think of His great sacrifice at Calv’ry!
  F#m               F#                   B7
I know my Lord expects the best from me.

Chorus:
     A             B7             E
How many are the lost that I have lifted?
     A              E                     F#m B7
How many are the chained I’ve helped to free?
   E              A               E
I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus,
      F#m      B7                E
When He has done so much for me?

The hours that I have wasted are so many,
The hours I’ve spent for Christ so few;
Because of all my lack of love for Jesus,
I wonder if His heart is breaking too.

I wonder, have I cared enough for others,
Or have I let them die alone?
I might have helped a wand’rer to the Saviour,
The seed of precious Life I might have sown.

No longer will I stay within the valley –
I’ll climb to mountain heights above;
The world is dying now for want of someone
To tell them of the Saviour’s matchless love.

224 (6/8 Gmaj)

G                D7       G               D7      G

   D7                     G               A            D7
He is my strength from day to day, without Him I would fall.
G                            G
When I am sad to Him I go, no other one can cheer me so;
Em                G                     Em D7 G
When I am sad, he makes me glad – He’s my Friend.

Jesus is all the world to me, my Friend in trials sore;
I go to Him for blessings, and He gives them o’er and o’er.
He sends the sunshine and the rain, He sends the harvest’s
golden grain;
Sunshine and rain, harvest of grain – He’s my Friend.

Jesus is all the world to me, and true to Him I’ll be;
Oh how could I this Friend deny, when He’s so true to me?
Following Him I know I’m right, He watches o’er me day and
night;
Following Him by day and night – He’s my Friend.

Jesus is all the world to me, I want no better friend;
I trust Him now, I’ll trust Him when life’s fleeting days shall end.
Beautiful life with such a Friend, beautiful life that has no end;
Eternal life, eternal joy – He’s my Friend.

Just as I am, without one plea
     G                   F      C
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
               C7           F
And that Thou bidd’st me come to Thee,
    C              G       C
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind:
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

226 (4/4 Gmaj)

G                          Am
Just a closer walk with Thee -
D7                         G
Grant it, Jesus, it’s my plea;
                           C
Daily walking close to Thee -
       G        D7           G
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

I am weak, but Thou art strong -
Jesus, keep me from all wrong;
I’ll be satisfied as long
As I walk, dear Lord, close to Thee.

Through this world of toil and snares,
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.

When my feeble life is o’er,
Time for me will be no more;
On that bright eternal shore
I will walk, dear Lord, close to Thee.

Jesus calls us o'er the tumult
       C                      B7
Of our life's wild, restless sea,
E7        A        D7            G
Day by day His sweet voice soundeth,
G7          C          D      G
Saying, "Christian, follow Me."

Jesus calls us from the worship
Of the vain world's golden store,
From each idol that would keep us,
Saying, "Christian, love Me more."

In our joys and in our sorrows,
Days of toil and hours of ease,
Still he calls in cares and pleasures,
"Christian, love Me more than these."

Jesus calls us: by Thy mercies,
Saviour, may we hear Thy call,
Give our hearts to Thine obedience,
Serve and love Thee best of all.

228 (6/8 Dmaj)

     D                    G

Or over the stormy sea,
     D      A7          D       G
It may not be at the battle’s front
       D              A       D
My Lord will have need of me;
      A                   D
But if by a still, small voice He calls
       A              D
To paths I do not know,
                     A7           D      G
I’ll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in Thine,
     D                A         D
I’ll go where You want me to go.

Chorus:
     A                        D
I’ll go where You want me to go, dear Lord,
         A                  D
O’er mountain, or plain or sea;
                  A7          D         G
I’ll say what You want me to say, dear Lord,
     D            A         D
I’ll be what You want me to be.

Perhaps today there are loving words
Which Jesus would have me speak,
There may be now, in the paths of sin,
Some wand’rer whom I should seek;
O Saviour, if Thou wilt be my Guide,
Though dark and rugged the way,
My voice shall echo the message sweet,
I’ll say what You want me to say.

There’s surely somewhere a lowly place
In earth’s harvest fields so wide,
Where I may labour through life's short day
for Jesus the Crucified;
So, trusting my all unto Thy care –
I know Thou lovest me –
I’ll do Thy will with a heart sincere,
I’ll be what You want me to be.

You have longed for sweet peace and for faith to increase,
          A                   D
And have earnestly, fervently prayed;

But you cannot have rest or be perfectly blest
      A                   D
Until all on the altar is laid.

Chorus:
        G                   D
Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?
      G                E          A
Your heart does the Spirit control?
           D
You can only be blest and have peace and sweet rest
         A                           D
As you yield Him your body and soul.

Would you walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,
And have peace and contentment alway?
You must do His sweet will to be free from all ill –
On the altar your all you must lay.

O we never can know what the Lord will bestow
Of the blessings for which we have prayed,
Till our body and soul He doth fully control,
And our all on the altar is laid.

Who can tell all the love He will send from above,
And how happy our hearts will be made,
Of the fellowship sweet we shall share at His feet
When our all on the altar is laid!

I’d rather be His than have riches untold;

I’d rather have Jesus than houses or lands,
              Am         Dm G7         C
I’d rather be led by His nail-pierced hand.

Chorus:
         G      G7        F      C
Than to be the king of a vast domain
          G                 F    C
And be held in sin’s dread sway.
                C7         F    C
I’d rather have Jesus than anything
              G       F C
This world affords today.

I’d rather have Jesus than men’s applause,
I’d rather be faithful to His dear cause.
I’d rather have Jesus than worldwide fame,
I’d rather be true to His holy name.

He’s fairer than lilies of rarest bloom,
He’s sweeter than honey from out the comb.
He’s all that my hungering spirit needs,
I’d rather have Jesus and let Him lead.

I would be brave, for there is much to dare.

I would be friend of all – the foe, the friendless;
I would be giving, and forget the gift;
I would be humble, for I know my weakness;
I would look up, and laugh, and love, and lift;
I would look up, and laugh, and love, and lift.

I would be prayerful through each busy moment;
I would be constantly in touch with God;
I would be tuned to hear His slightest whisper;
I would have faith to keep the path Christ trod;
I would have faith to keep the path Christ trod.

When friend or foe forsake me, Lord, I will not shrink in fear.
Am              A7       D        G
I am looking to the King of kings.

I'm looking unto Jesus, He, who laid out ev'ry course.
He's run the race before us, of strength, the runner's source.
Oh, consider with attention He who took a servant's form;
Completed the requirement, to His Father's will conformed.

I'll run the race with patience, and endure what God deems best.
I’ll lay aside the sinful weights that make me fail the test.
I will search the Holy Scriptures that can ev’ry problem solve.
I’ll serve my God and Savior and that with great resolve!

Now Zacchaeus was a very little man
       E          B7       E
And a very little man was he.
     A           E B7          E
He climbed up to a sycamore tree
        B7                    E
For the Saviour he wanted to see,

For the Saviour he wanted to see.

He looked in-to the tree

I'm coming to your house for tea.

Let others see Jesus in you.

Your life’s a book more than God’s Word,
They’re reading it through and through;
Say, does it point them to the Lord,
Do others see Jesus in you?

What joy ’twill be at set of sun,
In mansions beyond the blue,
To find some souls that you have won;
’Cause others saw Jesus in you.

Then live for Christ both day and night,
Be faithful, be pure and true,
And lead the lost to Christ our light;
Let others see Jesus in you.

Our hearts must be stirred, till all have heard

Till my life burns out for Thee.

How cold has been our giving, Lord;
How selfish our love has been,
Keeping from those who never heard
The gospel that saves from sin.
How often we have turned aside,
Neglecting to do our part,
Forgetting the shame of Calvary,
Forgetting Thy bleeding heart.

O Lord, with shame I humbly bow
In tears and a contrite heart.
Forgive me for the broken vows
And failure to do my part.
I heed Thy call and say, “Farewell,”
To all that would hinder me.
Thy grace and Thy love to lost ones tell
Till my life burns out for Thee.

Keep me strong, Lord Jesus, keep me strong,
Keep me strong, Lord Jesus, keep me strong.

There’s a victory to be won,
Every hour, by Thy power, I’ll be strong.

Jesus, I my cross have taken,
D                D7
All to leave and follow Thee;

Destitute, despised, forsaken –
D                      D7     G
Thou from hence my all shall be.
D              D7
Perish every fond ambition –
G                    D        D7
All I've sought or hoped and known!
G
Yet how rich is my condition –
D                      D7     G
God and heav’n are still my own!

Let the world despise and leave me,
They have left my Saviour too;
Human hearts and looks deceive me –
Thou art not, like man, untrue.
And while Thou shalt smile upon me,
God of wisdom, love, and might,
Foes may hate, and friends may shun me –
Show Thy face, and all is bright!

Man may trouble and distress me,
'Twill but drive me to Thy breast;
Life with trials hard may press me –
Heav’n will bring me sweeter rest.
O 'tis not in grief to harm me
While Thy love is left to me;
O 'twere not in joy to charm me
Were that joy unmixed with Thee!

Haste thee on from grace to glory,
Armed by faith and winged by prayer;
Heav’n's eternal day's before thee –
God's own hand shall guide thee there.
Soon shall close thy earthly mission,
Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days;
Hope shall change to glad fruition,
Faith to sight, and prayer to praise!

And now, O King eternal, we lift our battle song.

Lead on, O King eternal, till sin’s fierce war shall cease,
And holiness shall whisper the sweet amen of peace;
For not with swords loud clashing nor roll of stirring drums,
With deeds of love and mercy the heav’nly kingdom comes.

Lead on, O King eternal, we follow, not with fears;
For gladness breaks like morning where’er Thy face appears;
Thy cross is lifted o’er us, we journey in its light:
The crown awaits the conquest; Lead on, O God of might.

Out of distress to jubilant psalm,

Out of the fear and dread of the tomb,
Jesus, I come; Jesus, I come;
Into the joy and light of Thy home,

Out of the depths of ruin untold,
Into the peace of Thy sheltering fold,
Ever Thy glorious face to behold,

Lest I forget Thy love for me,

Lead me to Calvary.

Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,
Tenderly mourned and wept;
Angels in robes of light arrayed
Guarded Thee whilst Thou slept.

Let me like Mary, through the gloom,
Come with a gift to Thee;
Show to me now the empty tomb,
Lead me to Calvary.

May I be willing, Lord, to bear
Daily my cross for Thee;
Even Thy cup of grief to share -
Thou hast borne all for me.

O let me feel Thee near me: the world is ever near;
I see the sights that dazzle, the tempting sounds I hear;
My foes are ever near me, around me and within;
But, Jesus, draw Thou nearer, and shield my soul from sin.

O let me hear Thee speaking in accents clear and still,
Above the storms of passion, the murmurs of self-will;
O speak to reassure me, to hasten or control;
O speak, and make me listen, Thou guardian of my soul.

O Jesus, Thou hast promised, to all who follow Thee,
That where Thou art in glory, there shall Thy servant be;
And, Jesus, I have promised to serve Thee to the end:
O give me grace to follow, my Master and my friend.

Living for Jesus who died in my place,
Bearing on Calv'ry my sin and disgrace;
Such love constrains me to answer His call,
Follow His leading and give Him my all.

Living for Jesus wherever I am,
Doing each duty in His holy name;
Willing to suffer affliction and loss,
Taking each trial as part of my cross.

Living for Jesus through earth's little while,
My dearest treasure, the light of His smile;
Seeking the lost ones He died to redeem,
Bringing the weary to find rest in Him.

Barren and dark and cold,
A7                              G
He sought the sheep that was straying,
Am                           D7
He brought me back to the fold.

Chorus:
G                                D
Jesus, Jesus, dearer than all to me,
                                     G
Jesus, Jesus, Thine, only Thine I’ll be;
                     D7      G
Where Thou dost lead I will follow,
G7                        C
Where’er the path may be;
A7                           G
Then when life’s journey is ended,
Am                D7 G
Thy face in glory I’ll see.

Jesus the sweet rose of Sharon,
Jesus the lily so fair;
Jesus my rock and salvation,

Jesus the bright morning star;
He is my portion forever,
My all in all is He!
With Him I cannot be lonely,
He fully satisfies me.

Jesus was born in a manger,
Wept in the garden alone;
Poured out His life’s blood on Calv’ry,
Died for our sin to atone;
Rose from the grave more than conq’ror,
Went to His home on high;
Soon He is coming in glory,
Coming in clouds of the sky.

O to be like Thee! blessed Redeemer,
                                       A
This is my constant longing and prayer;
             D       G               D
Gladly I’ll forfeit all of earth’s treasures,
              A Bm E                 A
Jesus Thy perfect likeness to wear.

Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art!

Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness;
                           A7        D
Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.

O to be like Thee! full of compassion,
Loving, forgiving, tender and kind;
Helping the helpless, cheering the fainting,
Seeking the wandr’ing sinner to find.

O to be like Thee! lowly in spirit,
Holy and harmless, patient and brave;
Meekly enduring cruel reproaches,
Willing to suffer others to save.

O to be like Thee! Lord, I am coming,
Now to receive th’ anointing divine;
All that I am and have I am bringing –
Lord, from this moment all shall be Thine.

O to be like Thee! while I am pleading,
Pour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love;
Make me a temple meet for Thy dwelling.
Fit me for life and heaven above.

O Master, let me walk with Thee

In lowly paths of service free;
A7           D         G         Em
Tell me Thy secret; help me bear
 D    A D G D Em A D
The strain of toil, the fret of care.

Help me the slow of heart to move
By some clear, winning word of love;
Teach me the wayward feet to stay,
And guide them in the homeward way.

Teach me Thy patience! still with Thee
In closer, dearer, company,
In work that keeps faith sweet and strong,
In trust that triumphs over wrong;

In hope that sends a shining ray
Far down the future’s broad’ning way,
In peace that only Thou canst give,
With Thee, O Master, let me live.

Tune 1 (3/4 Dmaj):
D                 G        D     Bm       F#m        G    A
O for a closer walk with God, a calm and heav’nly frame,
   Bm      F#m G           D         Bm     A7       D
A light to shine upon the road that leads me to the Lamb!

Where is that blessedness I knew when first I saw the Lord?
Where is the soul-refreshing view of Jesus and His word?

What peaceful hours I once enjoyed! How sweet their memory
still!
But they have left an aching void the world can never fill.

Return, O holy Dove! return, sweet messenger of rest!
I hate the sins that made thee mourn, and drove thee from my
breast.

The dearest idol I have known, whate'er that idol be,
Help me to tear it from thy throne, and worship only thee.

So shall my walk be close with God, serene calm and my frame;
So purer light shall mark the road that leads me to the Lamb.

Tune 2 (3/4 Dmaj):
D         A      G        D      Bm       F#m        G    A
O for a closer walk with God, a calm and heav’nly frame,
   Bm      F#m     G        D        Bm      A7      D
A light to shine upon the road that leads me to the Lamb!

251 (4/4 Amaj)

A                             D              A
Hear ye the Master’s call, “Give Me thy best!”
E           A              B7          E
For, be it great or small, that is His test.
A                            A7          D
Do then the best you can, not for reward,
              A              D       E A
Not for the praise of men, but for the Lord.

Chorus:
E                    D        A
Every work for Jesus will be blest,
E                      F#m        C#
But He asks from everyone his best.
A                         A7           D
Our talents may be few, these may be small,
          A              D     E A
But unto Him is due our best, our all.

Wait not for men to laud, heed not their slight;
Winning the smile of God brings its delight!
Aiding the good and true ne’er goes unblest,
All that we think or do, be it the best.

Night soon comes on apace, day hastens by;
Workman and work must face testing on high.
Oh, may we in that day find rest, sweet rest,
Which God has promised those who do their best.

252 (4/4 Cmaj)

C              G      F            C
Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart,

Draw me, my Saviour, so precious Thou art;
C              G C      F            G
Fold me, O fold me close to Thy breast,
Am F           C           G         C
Shelter me safe in that “Haven of Rest,”
F             C               G      C
Shelter me safe in that “Haven of Rest.”

Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,
Naught as an off’ring to Jesus, my King;
Only my sinful, now contrite heart;
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart,
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.

Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine,
Sin, with its follies I gladly resign;
All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride;
Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified,
Give me but Jesus, my Lord crucified.

253 (6/8 Gmaj)

G                               C        D
With my whole heart I humbly seek You;

Now use my life, O Lord, I pray.

I yield my stubborn will completely;
                                     D7
May your commandments light my way.

Chorus:
G                  Am               D              G
My life, Lord, is yours to control; I give You my heart and my soul.
Em                   Am          D7                 G
I'll seek Your will, never mine, Rich treasure to find.
G                    Am            D            G
Give wisdom to choices I make, Along ev'ry path that I take.
Em               Am              D7                     G
So when I complete life's race "Well done", You will say.

Your Word has promised me the vict'ry,
And all I need to do is claim
Your strength to soar with wings as eagles,
To walk, to run, and not to faint.

254 (4/4 Gmaj)

More love to Thee, O Christ, more love to Thee!

Hear Thou the prayer I make on bended knee;
C           G
This is my earnest plea:

Chorus:
D              G
More love, O Christ, to Thee,
C             G Am D7            G
More love to Thee, more love to Thee!

Once earthly joy I craved, sought peace and rest;
Now Thee alone I seek, give what is best;
This all my prayer shall be:

Let sorrow do its work, send grief and pain;
Sweet are Thy messengers, sweet their refrain,
When they can sing with me:

Then shall my latest breath whisper Thy praise;
This be the parting cry my heart shall raise;
This still its prayer shall be:

255 (6/8 Cmaj)

C                    G
More like the Master I would ever be,
G7                       C
More of His meekness, more humility;
             C7           F
More zeal to labor, more courage to be true,
D7           G          D7              G
More consecration for work He bids me do.

Chorus:
C                                       G
Take Thou my heart, I would be Thine alone;
G7                                         C
Take Thou my heart, and make it all Thine own.
                      A             Dm
Purge me from sin, O Lord, I now implore,
D7           G C                G7 C
Wash me and ke-ep me Thine forevermore.

More like the Master is my daily prayer,
More strength to carry crosses I must bear;
More earnest effort to bring His kingdom in,
More of His Spirit, the wanderer to win.

More like the Master I would live and grow,
More of His love to others I would show;
More self-denial, like His in Galilee,
More like the Master I long to ever be.

          C       G            C                  D
He went into the garden and sought His Father’s will.
   G             C G                   D7     G
I read about His anguish and feel His sorrow there;
   C                G           C     D7     G
I see Him humbly kneeling and listen to His prayer.

Chorus:
C       D7        G           C           D7 G
Not my will but Thine, Lord; lead me to Calvary.
C        D            Em A        C      D7      G
Make my life a living sacrifice – Crucified for Thee.

My Lord became a servant, a man of lowly birth;
He laid aside His glory to dwell with sons of earth.
But now He is exalted, let every tongue proclaim –
And some day all shall praise Him, and magnify His name.

Lord Jesus, I surrender, my will shall be Thine own;
I lay aside ambition and bow before Thy throne.
I’ll give myself for others as Thou didst die for me –
Lord, send me forth with power to live my life for Thee.

More, more about Jesus;

More of His saving fullness see,
C           G          D7     G
More of His love who died for me.

More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God, my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.

More about Jesus in His Word,
Holding communion with my Lord,
Hearing His voice in every line,
Making each faithful saying mine.

More about Jesus on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own,
More of His kingdom’s sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of Peace.

D       G                Em       G A7          D
By His love and pow’r controlling all I do and say.

May the Word of God dwell richly in my heart from hour to hour,
So that all may see I triumph only through His pow’r.

May the peace of God, my Father, rule my life in ev’rything,
That I may be calm to comfort sick and sorrowing.

May the love of Jesus fill me, as the waters fill the sea;
Him exalting, self abasing, this is victory.

May I run the race before me, strong and brave to face the foe,
Looking only unto Jesus as I onward go.

May His beauty rest upon me as I seek the lost to win,
And may they forget the channel, seeing only Him.

To make me like You, Lord. Just make me like You.

But has given us the strength to obey.

May the Lord find us faithful
       Am             D7             G
Ev’ry day, though we live, though we die.

No man that seeketh after things of this life
Is a soldier who passes the test.
Be faithful, be working, be running, be serving,
Be searching His Word for His best.

Living or dying, may honour be Thine,
From this wretched life, You loved and forgave.
A life that is on fire, be only our heart’s desire.
Be faithful from now to the grave.

Make me a stranger on earth, dear Saviour,
G       D      A7       D
Till I see my heavenly home.

Lord, I’ve found myself loving earthly treasures:
Simple pleasures taking your place.
Nothing can measure to heavenly treasures:
Hearing, “Well done,” and seeing your face.

And there’s a cross for me.

The consecrated cross I’ll bear
Till death shall set me free,
And then go home my crown to wear,
For there’s a crown for me.

Upon the crystal pavement, down
At Jesus’ pierced feet,
Joyful I’ll cast my golden crown
And His dear name repeat.

O precious cross! O glorious crown!
O resurrection day!
Ye angels, from the stars come down
And bear my soul away.

O make me love Thee more and more.

Jesus, too late I Thee have sought,
How can I love Thee as I ought?
And how extol Thy matchless fame,
The glorious beauty of Thy name?

Jesus, what didst Thou find in me,
That Thou hast dealt so lovingly?
How great the joy that Thou hast brought
So far exceeding hope or thought!

Jesus, of Thee shall be my song,
To Thee my heart and soul belong;
All that I have or am is Thine,
And Thou, blest Saviour, Thou art mine.

“Ready and willing, Lord, here am I.”

Willing, my Saviour, to take up the cross;
Willing to suffer reproaches and loss.
Willing to follow, if Thou will but lead;
Only support me with grace in my need.

Living or dying, I still would be Thine;
Yet I am mortal while Thou art divine.
Pardon whenever I turn from the right;
Pity and bring me again to the light.

Ready and willing to give You my talent.
Show me the task and I’ll serve You today.

O feed me, Lord, that I may feed
Thy hung’ring ones with manna sweet.

O teach me, Lord, that I may teach
The precious things thou dost impart;
And wing my words that they may reach
The hidden depths of many a heart.

O fill me with Thy fullness, Lord,
Until my very heart o’erflow
In kindling thought and glowing word,
Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.

O use me, Lord, use even me,
Just as thou wilt, and when, and where,
Until Thy blessed face I see,
Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.

Lord Jesus, my King, I consecrate my life, Lord to Thee.

What’s done for Him will last.

I follow Thee, My Lord,
And glory in Thy cross;
I gladly leave the world behind
And count all gain as loss.

I’ll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death,
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;
And say, when the deathdew lies cold on my brow:
“If ever I loved Thee, my Jesus, ‘tis now.”

Through sorrow, or through joy, conduct me as Thine own,

And help me still to say, My Lord, Thy will be done.

My Jesus, as Thou wilt! If needy here and poor,
Give me Thy people's bread, their portion rich and sure;
The manna of Thy word Let my soul feed upon;
And if all else should fail, My Lord, Thy will be done.

My Jesus, as Thou wilt! Though seen through many a tear,
Let not my star of hope grow dim or disappear;
Since Thou on earth hast wept, and sorrowed oft alone,
If I must weep with Thee, My Lord, Thy will be done.

My Jesus, as Thou wilt! All shall be well for me;
Each changing future scene I gladly trust with Thee.
Straight to my home above I travel calmly on,
And sing, in life or death, My Lord, Thy will be done.

Lead me, Saviour, all the way.

Thou, the refuge of my soul,
When life's stormy billows roll;

All my hopes on Thee rely.

Saviour, lead me then at last,
When the storm of life is past,
To the land of endless day,
Where all tears are wiped away.

Before the soldiers’ spite and scorn

I see my Saviour stand.

He bears between the Romans guards
       C       Dm Em A
The weight of all our woe;

A stumbling figure bowed and scarred

All the unnumbered sins of man

I see my Saviour bear.

He hangs, by whom the world was made,
Beneath the darkened sky;
The everlasting ransom paid,
I see my Saviour die.
He shares on high His Father’s throne,
Who once in mercy came;
For all His love to sinners shown,
I sing my Saviour’s name.

This will I do, my dying Lord:
  D       A        D
I will remember Thee.

Thy body, broken for my sake,
My bread from heav’n shall be;
Thy testamental cup I take,
And thus remember Thee.

Gethsemane can I forget?
Or there Thy conflict see,
Thine agony, and bloody sweat,
And not remember Thee?

When to the cross I turn mine eyes,
And rest on Calvary,
O Lamb of God, my sacrifice,
I must remember Thee –

Remember Thee and all Thy pains
And all Thy love to me;
Yea, while a breath, a pulse remains,
Will I remember Thee.

And when these failing lips grow dumb
And mind and mem’ry flee,
When Thou shalt in Thy kingdom come,
Jesus, remember me!

274 (4/4 Emaj)

E
Alas! And did my Saviour bleed
     A      E         B7
And did my Sov’reign die?
       E
Would He devote that sacred Head
    A      B7      E
For such a worm as I?

Chorus:
                                   B7
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,
                                      E
And the burden of my heart rolled away –
       A                    E
It was there by faith I received my sight,
     A         B7              E
And now I am happy all the day!

Was it for crimes that I have done,
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut His glories in,
When Christ, the might Maker, died
For man, the creature’s sin.

But drops of grief can ne’er repay
The debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give myself away –
‘Tis all that I can do!

275 (4/4 Emaj)

         E       A        E
It was alone the Saviour prayed
    B7             E
In dark Gethsemane;
           E                A
Alone He drained the bitter cup
     E        B7       E
And suffered there for me.

Chorus:
  A      E       F#            B7
Alone, alone, He bore it all alone;
    E        E7                 A
He gave Himself to save His own,
   E         C#       F#m B7        E
He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.

It was alone the Saviour stood
In Pilate’s judgment hall;
Alone the crown of thorns He wore,
Forsaken thus by all.

Alone upon the cross He hung
That others He might save;
Forsaken then by God and man,
Alone, His life He gave.

Years I spent in vanity and pride,
G7                       C
Caring not my Lord was crucified
C
Knowing not it was for me He died
   F G C C7
On Cal-va-ry

Chorus:
F                            C
Mercy there was great, and grace was free,
G                       C      C7
Pardon there was multiplied to me,
F                              C
There my burdened soul found liberty –
    F G C
At Cal-va-ry.

By God's Word at last my sin I learned –
Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned,
Till my guilty soul imploring turned
To Calvary.

Now I've giv'n to Jesus everything,
Now I gladly own Him as my King,
Now my raptured soul can only sing,
Of Calvary.

O the love that drew salvation's plan!
O the grace that brought it down to man!
O the mighty gulf that God did span
At Calvary.

277 (4/4 Emaj)

I'm not ashamed to own my Lord,
   A     E        B7
Or to defend my cause,
     E
Maintain the honour of His Word,
     A    B7     E
The glory of His cross.

Chorus:
                                    B7
At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,
                                      E
And the burden of my heart rolled away –
        A                  E
It was there by faith I received my sight,
     A         B7              E
And now I am happy all the day!

Jesus, my God! I know His name –
His name is all my trust;
Now will He put my soul to shame,
Nor let my hope be lost.

Firm as His throne His promise stands,
And He can well secure
What I've committed to His hands,
Till the decisive hour.

Then will He set my worthless name
Before His Father's face;
And, in the new Jerusalem,
Appoint my soul a place.

    C
Beneath the cross of Jesus
  G7                  C
I fain would take my stand,
 E7 Am
The shadow of a mighty rock
    Dm Cm        E
Within a weary land;
   C                     C7
A home within the wilderness,
   F     A       Dm
A rest upon the way,
           G             C        C7
From the burning of the noontide heat,
F        C      G7      C
And the burden of the day.

Upon the cross of Jesus,
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me.
And from my smitten heart with tears,
These wonders I confess, -
The wonder of His glorious love,
And my own worthlessness.

I take, O cross, thy shadow
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
Then sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain or loss,
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross.

Far dearer than all that the world can impart
                         A           D7
Was the message that came to my heart;
          G      G7           C        Cm
How that Jesus alone for my sin did atone,
     G        D7        G
And Calvary covers it all.

Chorus:
 C         G              Em           D7         G G7
Calvary covers it all, My past with its sin and stain;
    C                        G
My guilt and despair Jesus took on Him there,
              D7        G
And Calvary covers it all.

The stripes that He bore and the thorns that He wore
Told His mercy and love evermore;
And my heart bowed in shame as I called on His name,
And Calvary covers it all.

How matchless the grace, when I looked on the face
Of this Jesus, my crucified Lord;
My redemption complete I then found at His feet,
And Calvary covers it all.

How blessed the thought that my soul by Him bought,
Shall be His in the glory on high;
Where with gladness and song I’ll be one of the throng,
And Calvary covers it all.

When I survey the wondrous cross,
                 A       E     B7
On which the Prince of glory died,
E                  F#m B7 E
My richest gain I count but loss,

And pour contempt on all my pride.

Tune 2 (Rockingham 3/4 Cmaj):

When I survey the wondrous cross,
                F       C      G
On which the Prince of glory died,
    C       G      C    D G
My richest gain I count but loss,
     Dm       G       Am G7 C
And pour contempt on all my pride.

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
Save in the death of Christ my God:
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were an off’ring far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

281 (4/4 Cmaj)

       C               F         C
There is a fountain filled with blood
                              G
Drawn from Emmanuel’s veins;
     C                        F       C
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
               G7      C
Lose all their guilty stains.
               G       F
Lose all their guilty stains,
     C                  G
Lose all their guilty stains;
    C                         F       C
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
               G7      C
Lose all their guilty stains.

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there have I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away;
And there have I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its pow’r,
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved to sin no more.
Be saved to sin no more,
Be saved to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed church of God
Be saved to sin no more.

E’er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die;
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

When this poor, lisping, stamm’ring tongue
Lies silent in the grave,
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I’ll sing Thy pow’r to save,
I’ll sing Thy pow’r to save,
I’ll sing Thy pow’r to save;
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I’ll sing Thy pow’r to save.

Life is filled with song, all because of Calvary;

Christ my Saviour lives, lives from sin to set me free;

      A                      D
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
     E           E7            A
The emblem of suff'ring and shame;
                            A7         D
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
       E            E7            A
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

Chorus:
        E            E7            A A7
So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,
          D                     A
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
                    A7           D
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
            A             E          A
And exchange it someday for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wonderful beauty I see;
For ’twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died
To pardon and sanctify me.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true,
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He’ll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I’ll share.

       E               B7 E
There is a green hill far away,
    B7          E
Without a city wall,
        E                   B7 C#m
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
    F#m       F#       B7
Who died to save us all.

Chorus:

O dearly, dearly has He loved!
   C#m        F#        B7
And we must love Him too,

And trust in His redeeming blood,
             B7       E
And try His works to do.

We may not know, we cannot tell
What pains He had to bear;
But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffered there.

He died that we might be forgiv’n,
He died to make us good,
That we might go at last to heav’n,
Saved by His precious blood.

There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin;
He only could unlock the gate
Of heav’n and let us in.

There was One who was willing to die in my stead,
                    A               D
That a soul so unworthy might live;

And the path to the cross He was willing to tread,

All the sins of my life to forgive.

Chorus:

O how much He was willing to bear!
          D                          G           D
With what anguish and loss Jesus went to the cross!
        Em          A              D
But He carried my sins with Him there.

He is tender and loving and patient with me,
While He cleanses my heart of the dross;
But “there’s no condemnation” – I know I am free,
For my sins are all nailed to the cross.

I will cling to my Saviour and never depart –
I will joyfully journey each day.
With a song on my lips and a song in my heart,
That my sins have been taken away.

I hear the Saviour say,
         A                  D
"Thy strength indeed is small;
D                              Bm
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
        D        A7 D
Find in Me thine all in all."

Chorus:
D
Jesus paid it all,
              A
All to Him I owe;
D                       G
Sin had left a crimson stain,
      D         A7      D
He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow’r, and Thine alone,
Can change the leper’s spots,
And melt the heart of stone.

For nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim;
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calvary's Lamb.

And when, before the throne,
I stand in Him complete,
“Jesus died my soul to save,”
My lips shall still repeat.

   G C             D7      G
It is a thing most wonderful,
     C        A      D
Almost too wonderful to be,
        G          C            A    D
That God’s own Son should come from heav’n
       G      C      D7       G
And die to save a child like me.

And yet I know that it is true:
He came to this poor world below,
And wept and toiled and mourned and died,
Only because He loved us so.

I cannot tell how He could love
A child so weak and full of sin;
His love must be most wonderful,
If He could die my love to win.

I sometimes think about His cross,
And shut my eyes, and try to see
The cruel nails, and crown of thorns,
And Jesus crucified for me.

But even could I see Him die,
I could but see a little part
Of that great love which, like a fire,
Is always burning in His heart.

It is most wonderful to know
His love for me so free and sure;
But ‘tis more wonderful to see
My love for Him so faint and poor.

And yet I want to love Thee, Lord:
O light the flame within my heart,
And I will love Thee more and more
Until I see Thee as Thou art!

288 (4/4 Dmaj)

D                                      A
Lord, crucified, give me a heart like Thine;
                       A7              D
Teach me to love the dying souls of men;
                       G
Oh, keep my heart in closest touch with Thee,
      D                 Em
And give me love, pure Calv'ry's love;
              A7      D
To bring the lost to Thee.

E                  A
Jesus, keep me near the cross,
E                   B7
There a precious fountain
E               A
Free to all, a healing stream
E                      B7 E
Flows from Calvary’s mountain.

Chorus:
E              A
In the cross, in the cross,
E              B7
Be my vision glorious;
E                 A
All my sins are washed away,
E               B7 E
In the blood of Je-sus.

Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the bright and morning Star
Sheds its beams around me.

Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o’er me.

Near the cross I’ll watch and wait
Hoping, trusting, ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river.

I gave My life for thee,

My precious blood I shed,
       A                       D
That thou might’st ransomed be,
      A           E         A
And quickened from the dead;
   E                 A
I gave, I gave My life for thee,
     E                   A
What hast thou giv’n for Me?

My Father’s house of light,
My glory-circled throne
I left for earthly night,
For wand’rings sad and lone;
I left, I left it all for thee,
Hast thou left aught for Me?

I suffered much for thee,
More than thy tongue can tell,
Of bitterest agony,
To rescue thee from hell;
I’ve borne, I’ve borne it all for thee,
What hast thou borne for Me?

And I have brought to thee,
Down from My home above,
Salvation full and free,
My pardon and My love;
I bring, I bring rich gifts to thee,
What hast thou brought to Me?

Why did Jesus give up heaven’s glory
           A                  D
For this world of sin and misery?
                             Em
Why did Jesus suffer in the garden,
           A               D
Drain the bitter cup of agony?
         Em              A                  D Bm
Why did Jesus stand in Pilate’s judgement hall,
           E                              A A7
Wear that cruel crown of thorns so patiently?
         D                     Em
Why did Jesus give His life to save me?
        A                            D
It was love, God’s wondrous love for me.

Why does Jesus lift me when I stumble,
Take my hand whene’er I go astray?
Give me strength I need for each tomorrow,
Grace to face the trials of the day?
Why does Jesus share the load I cannot bear,
Fill my soul with peace and joy beyond degree?
And why does He watch o’er me and keep me?
It was love, God’s wondrous love for me.

Ruined sinners to reclaim!

Hallelujah! What a Saviour!

Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
In my place condemned He stood;
Sealed my pardon with His blood:
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!

Guilty, vile and helpless, we;
Spotless Lamb of God was He:
Full atonement! – can it be?
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!

Lifted up was He to die;
“It is finished!” was His cry;
Now in heav’n exalted high:
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!

When He comes, our glorious King,
All His ransomed home to bring,
Then anew this song we’ll sing:
Hallelujah! What a Saviour!

Many soon will follow in the choices that we make.

Be steadfast in love, in faith in purity of life.

For those behind us, let us stand within the gap and
         Am                  G Em
make a diff'rence in their lives;
         Am        D7      G
Be an example to follow Christ.

Let us then be watching the weary, day by day,
Looking to encourage and to lead in the way;
To run the race with patience; On Jesus fix our eyes,
And challenge them with excellence, that they might win the prize.

Only Thy praise be told
Let all my heart be sold

Or blush to speak His name?

Must I be carried to the skies
On flow’ry beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed through bloody seas?

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stern the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God?

Sure I must fight, if I would reign;
Increase my courage, Lord;
I’ll bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by Thy Word.

Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.

With no pow’r but as Thou givest
Graciously with each command.

Witnessing Thy pow’r to save me,
Setting free frin self and sin
Thou who boughtest to possess me,
In Thy fullness, Lord, come in.

Hearts that full surrender know,
That the streams of living water
From our inner man may flow

My body is the temple of the Lord.

Every day the Lord Himself is near me,
With a special mercy for each hour;
All my cares He fain would bear, and cheer me,
He whose name is Counsellor and Pow’r.
The protection of his child and treasure,
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
“As the days, thy strength shall be in measure,”
This the pledge to me He made.

Help me then in every tribulation,
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
That I lose not faith’s sweet consolation,
Offered me within Thy holy Word.
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
E’er to take, as from a father’s hand,
One by one, the days, the moment fleeting,
Till I reach the promised land.

Deeper, deeper in the love of Jesus
G            D7
Daily let me go;
G                               C
Higher, higher in the school of wisdom,
G         D7        G
More of grace to know.

Chorus:

O dee - per yet, I pray,

And higher every day,
     GC                G
And wi - ser, blessed Lord,
       Am        D7 G
In Thy precious, holy Word.

Deeper, deeper! Blessed Holy Spirit,
Take me deeper still,
Till my life is wholly lost in Jesus,
And His perfect will.

Deeper, deeper! Though it cost hard trials,
Deeper let me go!
Rooted in the holy love of Jesus,
Let me fruitful grow.

Deeper, higher, every day in Jesus,
Till all conflict past,
Finds me conqu’ror, and in His own image
Perfected at last.

309 (6/4 Gmaj)

G       Em             Am
Only to be what He wants me to be,
        D                 G
Every moment of every day;
            Em           Am
Yielded completely to Je-sus alone,
        D                   G
Every step of this pilgrim way:

Chorus:
B7                     Em
Just to be clay in the Po-tter’s hands,
A                       D           D7
Ready to do what His Word commands;

Only to be what He wants me to be,

Every moment of every day.

Trusting my Saviour whatever betide,
Every moment of every day;
Knowing He’s able and ready to guide,
Every step of this pilgrim way:

Living for Jesus, surrendered and true,
Every moment of every day;
Walking with only His pleasure in view,
Every step of this pilgrim way.

Father, lead me day by day,
A           A7      D
Ever in Thy loving way.
G                D       B7
May my life be pure and true,
Em                A      D
Show me what I ought to do.

When I’m tempted to do wrong,
Make me steadfast, wise and strong;
And when all alone I stand,
Shield me with Thy mighty hand.

As I travel on life’s sea,
Help me to remember Thee,
Happy most of all to know
That my Father loves me so.

May I do the good I know,
Be Thy loving child below,
Then at last go home to Thee,
Evermore Thy child to be.

311 (4/4 Amaj)

         A                         E7
Like the woman at the well I was seeking
       E                    A
For things that could not satisfy;
             A7                  D
And then I heard my Saviour speaking:
                 E                      A
“Draw from My well that never shall run dry”

Chorus:
            A
Fill my cup, Lord,
          E
I lift it up, Lord !
                                        A
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul;
                       A7        D
Bread of heaven, feed me till I want no more –
         E                           A
Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole!

There are millions in the world who are craving
The pleasure earthly things afford;
But none can match the wondrous treasure
That I find in Jesus Christ, my Lord.

So, my brother, if the things this world would gave you
Leave hungers that won’t pass away,
My blessed Lord will come and save you,
If you kneel to Him and humbly pray.

312 (4/4 Emaj)

E               B7
Jesus calls me – I must follow,

Follow Him today;

When His tender voice is pleading
F#           B7
How can I delay?

Chorus:
E                      B7
Follow, I will follow Thee, my Lord,
                        E
Follow ev’ry passing day ( I will follow ev’ry day);
                          B7
My tomorrows are all known to Thee,
                             E
Thou wilt lead me all the way (all the way).

Jesus calls me – I must follow,
Follow ev’ry hour,
Know the blessing of His presence
Fullness of His pow’r.

Jesus calls me – I must follow,
Follow Him alway;
When my Saviour goes before me
I can never stray.

Why have You chosen me

Out of millions Your child to be ?

You know all the wrong I have done.

Forgive my i-ni-quity,

To save me, give Jesus Your Son?       Oh,…

Lord, help me be what You want me to be,

Your Word I will strive to obey;

My life I now give,

For You I will live,
      Em              A          D
And walk by Your side all the way.

I am amazed to know
That a God so great could love me so,
Is willing and wanting to bless;
His grace is so wonderful,
His mercy is so bountiful,
I can’t understand, I confess. But…

In this world of darkness,
Many lives are filled with emptiness,
They too need to know of Your love.
O Lord, help me point to them
The Truth, the Life, the Way,
And to light each path I tread from day to day. Oh,.

Fill my heart with love for Je-sus the Nazarene,

Fill my mouth with Thy praise,

Let me sing through endless days,

Take my will, let my life be wholly Thine.

Throw your soul’s fresh, glowing ardour
Dm       G           C

Jesus has set the example;

Dauntless was He, young and brave;

Join in the battle for truth.

Give of your best to the Master;
Give Him first place in your heart;
Give Him first place in your service,
Consecrate every part.
Give, and to you shall be given;
God His beloved Son gave;

Gratefully seeking to serve Him,
Give Him the best that you have.

Give of your best to the Master;
Naught else is worthy His love;
He gave Himself for your ransom,
Gave up His glory above:
Laid down His life without murmur,
You from sin’s ruin to save;
Give Him your heart’s adoration,
Give of your best that you have.

For me to live is Christ, to die is gain,
             Em          A7               D
To hold His hand and walk His narrow way;
                                 D7
There is no peace, no joy, no thrill
     G
Like walking in His will.
          D        A7                D
For me to live is Christ, to die is gain.

Now once my heart was full of sin and shame,
Till someone told me Jesus came to save;
When He said, “Come unto Me,”
He set my poor heart free,
For me to live is Christ, to die is gain.

Now there are things that I still do not know,
But of this one thing I’m completely sure;
He who called me on that day
Washed all my sins away.
For me to live is Christ, to die is gain.

317 (4/4 Cmaj)

C                      C7
God made a promise,
                    F
And He proved it true,
                   C           Am
He gave Jesus Christ His Son,
                   Dm G7
To die for me and you.
              C             C7
He gave us peace and joy,
              F
Life eternal too,
                C              G
And with His hand He guides
                     C
Us all the journey through.

Chorus:
C7 F                 G                C      Am
So, why shouldn’t we live for Jesus alone ?
     Dm                    G             C
And why shouldn’t our lives just be His own ?
    C7 F                      G
And so, why shouldn’t we live
                    C         Am
Every day and each moment,
         F             G               C
With our Saviour, our Lord upon the throne ?

Christ trudged this weary earth,
Not a complaint He made,
We’re always in His thoughts,
True to the cross He stayed.
Are your aware, my friend,

We’ve been bought with a price,
Each stripe on my Saviour’s back,
There’s where our healing lies.

318 (4/4 Emaj)

Sweet are the promises, kind is the word,
B7              E             B7
Dearer far than any message man ever heard;
E                             A         E
Pure was the mind of Christ, sinless I see,
B7              E             B7          E
He the great example is, and pattern for me.

Chorus:
A                   E        B7            E
Where He leads I’ll follow, follow all the way;
A                   E        B7                 E
Where He leads I’ll follow, follow Jesus ev’ry day.

Sweet is the tender love Jesus has shown,
Sweeter far than any love that mortals have known;
Kind to the erring one, faithful is He,
He the Great example is, and pattern for me.

List to His loving words ,”Come unto me!”
Weary, heavy laden, there is sweet rest for thee;
Trust in His promises, faithful and sure,
Lean up on the Saviour and thy soul is secure.

319 (3/4 Gmaj)

Go labour on, spend, and be spent,
             G     A        D
Thy joy to do the Father's will;
           G       C      D
It is the way the Master went;
G                C        D      G
Should not the servant tread it still?

Go, labour on; tis not for naught;
Thy earthly loss is heavenly gain;
Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not;
The Master praises what are men?

Go, labour on; your hands are weak,
Your knees are faint, your soul cast down;
Tet falter not; the prize you seek;
Is near a kingdom and a crown.

Go, labour on while it is day:
The world's dark night is hastening on;
Speed, speed thy work, cast sloth away;
It is not thus that souls are won.

Toil on, faint not, keep watch and pray;
Be wise the erring soul to win;
Go forth into the world's highway,
Compel the wanderer to come in.

Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice;
For toil comes rest, for exile home;
Soon shalt thou hear the Bridegroom's voice,
The midnight cry, "Behold, I come!"

The track of the footprints He leaves on our way;
    D         Bm               G             A
Far over the mountain and thro' the deep hollow,
     D              F#m         Em         A D
The path leads us on to the mansions of day:
D7 G                A              D           Bm
The Master hath called us, the children who fear Him,
      Em                      A            D      D7
Who march 'neath Christ's banner, His own little band;
     G              A             F#m         Bm
We love Him and seek Him, we long to be near Him,
     Em          A           G          D
And rest in the light of his beautiful land.

The Master hath called us; the road may be dreary,
And dangers and sorrows are strewn on the track;
But God's Holy Spirit shall comfort the weary;
We follow the Saviour and cannot turn back;
The Master hath called us: tho' doubt and temptation
May compass our journey, we cheerfully sing:
"Press onward, look upward," thro' much tribulation;
The children of Zion must follow their King.

The Master hath called us, in life's early morning,
With spirits as fresh as the dew on the sod:
We turn from the world, with it smiles and its scorning,
To cast in our lot with the people of God:
The Master hath called us, His sons and his daughters,
We plead for His blessing and trust in his love;
And thro' the green pastures, beside the still waters,
He'll lead us at last to His kingdom above.

                      Am              Dm              G7
The burden on my weary back has bound me to despair,

I oft complain to Jesus how folks are treating me,
       Am              Dm G7          C
And then I hear Him say so tenderly:
       F                      C
“My feet were also weary upon the Calvary road,
      Am                       D7               G
My cross became so heavy I fell beneath the load.
      C                C7           F            C
Be faithful, weary Christian, the morning I can see.
       Am                 Dm G7          C
Just lift your cross and follow close to Me.”

“I worked so hard for Jesus,” I often boast and say,
“I’ve sacrificed a lot of things to walk the narrow way;
I gave up fame and fortune – I’m worth a lot to Thee!”
And the I hear Him gently say to me:
“I left the throne of glory and counted it but loss,
My hands were nailed in anger upon the cruel cross;
But now we’ll make the journey with your hand safe in Mine -
So lift your cross and follow close to Me.”

I want to bear Thy fruit, O Lord, For Thy word speaks to me
And makes me yearn to bear this fruit – an offering unto Thee.

I want to bear Thy fruit, O Lord, let me abide in Thee,
The vine of Truth and nourishment, the source of fruit, so free!

I want to bear Thy fruit, O Lord, my heart I’ll not withhold;
I give to Thee all that I have to fashion and to mould.

I want to bear Thy fruit, O Lord, of love and gentleness,
Of peace and joy and self-control and blessed faithfulness.

I want to bear Thy fruit, O Lord, to bear them everyday!
So keep me clinging to Thy side forever, all the way!

I want to bear Thy fruit, O Lord, till Thou wilt come again;
Then, taken up, I can proclaim, “My life was not in vain!”

I want to bear Thy fruit, O Lord, O Jesus, hear my plea:
Bestir my soul, this moment start to change my life for Thee!

When I enter Heaven’s glory and I see my Saviour’s face,
       Dm              A                Dm       G
I will offer Him ten thousand years of praise.
           Em               Am          Em                Am
Then I’ll find that special one in whose life I saw God’s Son,
                Dm                                   G
And through tears of joy with trembling lips these words I’ll say:

Chorus:
       C        Dm          C       Dm
“I saw Jesus in you, I saw Jesus in you.
        Am
I could hear His voice in the words you said –
       D        G G7
I saw Jesus in you.
         C               G           Am               Fm
In your eyes I saw His care, I could see His love was there.
           C     Am      Dm G7         C
You were faithful, and I saw Jesus in you.”

When I stand before my Father to receive my life’s reward,
And my soul is bathed in God’s eternal day,
When this race on earth is run, and God sees the works I’ve
done,
More than anything I long to hear my Father say:

Surely goodness and mercy ever shall follow me,
All through the day the Lord my Shepherd be.
In the house of the Lord I will forever be,
His sheep am I.

He’s still working on me, to make me what I ought to be,

It took Him just His word to make the moon and the stars,

The sun and the earth and Jupiter and Mars.
                    B7             Em D         A7         D
How lovingly and patient He must be, He’s still working on me.

In the mirror of His Word, reflections that I see
Make me wonder why He never gave up on me;
But He loves me as I am and helps me when I pray,
Remember, He’s the Potter, I’m the clay.

Down in the valley with my Saviour I would go,
D                                          G          D7

Walking in His footsteps till the crown be won.

Anywhere, everywhere, I would follow on!

Follow! Follow! I would follow Jesus!
C                 G                D7  G
Everywhere He leads me I would follow on!

Down in the valley with my Saviour I would go,
Where the storms are sweeping and the dark waters flow;
With His hand to lead me I will never, never fear,
Danger cannot fright me if my Lord is near.

Down in the valley of upon the mountain steep,
Close beside my Saviour would my soul ever keep;
He will lead me safely in the path that He has trod,
Up to where they gather on the hills of God.

Not I but Christ be seen, be known, be heard;

Not I but Christ in ev’ry look and action;

Not I but Christ in ev’ry thought and word.

Chorus:

Oh, to be saved from myself, dear Lord!
Em          A       D     D7
Oh, to be lost in Thee!

Oh, that it may be no more I, dear Lord,
      D           A      D
But Christ that lives in me.

Not I but Christ to gently soothe in sorrow;
Not I but Christ to wipe the falling tear;
Not I but Christ to lift the heavy burden;
Not I but Christ to hush away all fear.

Christ, only Christ, ere long will fill my vision;
Glory excelling soon, full soon I’ll see –
Christ, only Christ my ev’ry wish fulfilling –
Christ, only Christ my all in all to be.

Why do you wait, dear brother,
     D                    G
Oh why do you tarry so long?
                 D           G
Your Saviour is waiting to give you
                D           G
A place in His sanctified throng.

Chorus:

Why not? Why not?

Why not come to Him now?

Why not? Why not?
 D                   G
Why not come to Him now?

What do you hope, dear brother,
To gain by a further delay?
There’s no one to save you but Jesus,
There’s no other way but His way.

Do you not feel, dear brother,
His Spirit now striving within?
Oh why not accept His salvation
And throw off your burden of sin?

Why do your wait, dear brother?
The harvest is passing away;
Your Savior is longing to bless you,
There’s danger and death in delay.

See, on the portals He’s waiting and watching,

Watching for you and for me.

Ye who are weary come home;
G          G7         C        G
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,
C           G        D7 G
Calling, O sinner, come home!

Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading,
Pleading for you and for me?
Why should we linger and heed not His mercies,
Mercies for you and for me?

Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing,
Passing from you and from me;
Shadows are gathering, deathbeds are coming,
Coming for you and for me.

O for the wonderful love He has promised,
Promised for you and for me;
Though we have sinned He has mercy and pardon,
Pardon for you and for me.

We've a story to tell to the nations

That shall turn their hearts to the right,
  G         A         D
A story of truth and mercy,

Chorus:

For the darkness shall turn to dawning,

And the dawning to noonday bright,
      Bm             G            A       Bm
And Christ's great kingdom shall come to earth,
      D           A        D
The kingdom of love and light.

We’ve a song to be sung to the nations
That shall lift their hearts to the Lord,
A song that shall conquer evil
And shatter the spear and sword,
And shatter the spear and sword.

We’ve a message to give to the nations-
That the Lord who reigneth above
Hath sent us His Son to save us
And show us that God is love,
And show us that God is love.

We’ve a Saviour to show to the nations
Who the path of sorrow has trod,
That all of the world’s great peoples
Might come to the truth of God,
Might come to the truth of God.

Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;

Weep o’er the erring one, lift up the fallen,
E            A          E           A
Tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.

Chorus:

Rescue the perishing, care for the dying;
 D       A         E           A
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.

Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive;
Plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently:
He will forgive if they only believe.

Down in the human heart, crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
Touched by a loving heart, wakened by kindness,
Chords that were broken will vibrate once more.

Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;
Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
Back to the narrow way patiently win them;
Tell the poor wand’rer a Saviour has died.

Send the light! Send the light!

There are souls to rescue there are souls to save,

Send the light! Send the light!

Chorus:

Send the light, the blessed Gospel light;

Let it shine from shore to shore!
            E
Send the light! the blessed Gospel light;
        B7           E
Let it shine forevermore.

We have heard the Macedonian call today,
Send the light! Send the light!
And a golden off’ring at the cross we lay,
Send the light! Send the light!

Let us pray that grace may ev’rywhere abound;
Send the light! Send the light!
And a Christ-like spirit ev’rywhere be found,
Send the light! Send the light!

Let us not grow weary in the work of love,
Send the light! Send the light!
Let us gather jewels for a crown above,
Send the light! Send the light!

Where the story has never been told;

To the millions that never have heard of His love,
        A             E         A
I must tell the sweet story of old.

Chorus:

To the regions beyond, I must go, I must go,

Till the world, all the world,
        E              A
His salvation shall know.

To the hardest of places He calls me to go,
Not thinking of comfort or ease;
The world may pronounce me a dreamer, a fool-
Enough if the Master I please.

Oh ye that are spending your leisure and powers
In pleasures so foolish and fond,
Awake from your selfishness, folly and sin,
And go to the regions beyond.

There are other lost sheep that the Master must bring,
And to them must the message be told.
He sends me to gather them out of all lands
And welcome them back to His fold.

Yes, there's room at the cross for you.

Though millions have found Him a friend
And have turned from the sins they have sinned,
The Saviour still waits to open the gates
And welcome a sinner before it's too late.

The hand of my Saviour is strong,
And the love of my Saviour is long;
Through sunshine or rain, through loss or in gain,
The blood flows from Calv’ry to cleanse every stain.

My built-up pride just burst there like a bubble,
My life fell down in fragments at my feet;
That single hour was longer than a lifetime.
When Jesus’ face I turned around to meet,
He freed my mind and spirit from my trouble,
My scaly eyes were opened just to see.
My failures left a thousand miles behind me,
His love was poured out there to set me free.

The wages sin pays out is death, my brother.
The bountiful, free gift of God is life.
Just open up your heart, let Jesus enter,
   A           E         A         E      B7

   E                E7
I heard about His groaning,
        A                  E
Of His precious blood's atoning,
                        C#m
Then I repented of my sins
     F#m     B7 E
And won the victory.

Chorus:
  E         E7         A          E
O victory in Jesus, My Saviour forever,
    C#m              E              F#             B7
He sought me and bought me With His redeeming blood;
    E               E7             A            E
He loved me ere I knew Him, And all my love is due Him,
     E                       B7                  E
He plunged me to victory Beneath the cleansing flood.

I heard about His healing,
Of His cleansing pow'r revealing.
How He made the lame to walk again
And caused the blind to see;
And then I cried, "Dear Jesus,
Come and heal my broken spirit,"
And somehow Jesus came and bro't
To me the victory.

I heard about a mansion
He has built for me in glory.
And I heard about the streets of gold
Beyond the crystal sea;
About the angels singing,
And the old redemption story,
And some sweet day I'll sing up there
The song of victory.

He who bore your load of sin?

Room for Jesus, King of glory!

Hasten now, His Word obey;

Swing the heart’s door widely open,
C       G       D7      G
Bid Him enter while you may.

Room for pleasure, room for business -
But, for Christ the Crucified,
Not a place that He can enter,
In the heart for which He died?

Have you any room for Jesus,
As in grace He calls again?
O today is time accepted,
Tomorrow you may call in vain.

Room and time now give to Jesus,
Soon will pass God’s day of grace;
Soon thy heart left cold and silent,
And thy Saviour’s pleading cease.

There’s a line that is drawn by rejecting our Lord,

Where the call of His Spirit is lost,
          G                       C            G
And you hurry along with the pleasure mad throng-
             C                    G     D7 G
Have you counted, have you counted the cost?

Chorus:
G                                   C              G
Have you counted the cost, if your soul should be lost,
                                           D
Though you gain the whole world for your own?
      G                       C             G
Even now it may be that the line you have crossed,
           C                    G     D7 G
Have you counted, have you counted the cost?

You may barter your hope of eternity’s morn,
For a moment of joy at the most,
For the glitter of sin and the things it will win-
Have you counted, have you counted the cost?

While the door of His mercy is open to you,
Ere the depth of His love you exhaust,
Won’t you come and be healed, won’t you whisper I yield -
I have counted, I have counted the cost.

I found in him a resting place, and He has made me glad.

I heard the voice of Jesus say, "Behold, I freely give
The living water – thirsty one, stoop down and drink, and live."
I came to Jesus, and I drank of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived, and now I live in him.

I heard the voice of Jesus say, "I am this dark world's Light;
Look unto me, thy morn shall rise, and all thy day be bright."
I looked to Jesus, and I found in Him my Star, my Sun;
And in that light of life I'll walk, till trav’ling days are done.

In the blood of Calvary.

I know a Saviour, He's a faithful friend,
One who is with me, will be to the end.
He now in glory intercedes for me,
'Twas His precious cleansing blood,
That once flowed on Calvary.

I have a peace, this world could never give,
Wonderful peace, for now in Christ I live.
From condemnation He hath made me free,
What a wonder working pow'r,
In the blood of Calvary.

I have a hope, My Lord will surely come,
All His redeemed ones shall be gathered home.
With him in glory evermore to be,
Then we'll praise Him for the blood,
That was shed on Calvary.

Wash me, cleanse me, in the blood that flowed on Calvary!

Though coming weak and vile, Thou dost my strength assure;
Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse, till spotless all and pure.

‘Tis Jesus calls me on to perfect faith and love,
To perfect hope and peace and trust for earth and heav’n above.

I am counting all but dross; I shall full salvation find.

Long my heart has sighed for Thee; long has evil reigned within;
Jesus sweetly speaks to me, “I will cleanse you from all sin.”

Here I give my all to Thee; friends, and time, and earthly store;
Soul and body Thine to be, wholly Thine for evermore.

Jesus comes! He fills my soul! Perfected in Him I am;
I am every whit made whole – Glory, glory to the Lamb!

There’s a sweet and blessed story

Of the Christ who came from glory,
         E                     A
Just to rescue me from sin and misery;

He in loving-kindness sought me,
                    E          A
And from sin and shame has brought me,
D     E                     A
Hallelujah! Jesus ransomed me.

Chorus:

Who can take a poor, lost sinner,

Lift him from the miry clay and set him free;

Shouting, glory, glory, glory,
D       E                      A
Hallelujah! Jesus ransomed me.

From the depth of sin and sadness
To the heights of joy and gladness
Jesus lifted me, in mercy full and free;
With His precious blood He bought me,
When I knew Him not, He sought me,
And in love divine He ransomed me.

By and by with joy increasing,
And with gratitude unceasing,
Lifted up with Christ forevermore to be,
I will join the hosts there singing,
In the anthem ever ringing,
To the King of Love who ransomed me.

He took my sins away.

The load of sin was more than I could bear,
He took them all away, He took them all away,
And now on Him I roll my ev’ry care,
He took my sins away.

No condemnation have I in my heart,
He took my sins away, He took my sins away,
His perfect peace He did to me impart,
He took my sins away.

If you will come to Jesus Christ today,
He’ll take your sins away, He’ll take your sins away,
And keep you happy in His love each day,
He’ll take your sins away.

To tell the old, old story of Jesus and His love.

I love to tell the story, more wonderful it seems
Than all the golden fancies of all our golden dreams.
I love to tell the story, it did so much for me;
And that is just the reason I tell it now to thee.

I love to tell the story, ‘tis pleasant to repeat
What seems, each time I tell it, more wonderfully sweet;
I love to tell the story, for some have never heard
The message of salvation from God’s own Holy Word.

I love to tell the story, for those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest.
And when, in scenes of glory, I sing the new, new song,
‘Twill be the old, old story that I have loved so long.

Come into my heart, blessed Jesus,
I need Thee through life's dreary way;
The burden of sin is so heavy,

Come into my heart, blessed Jesus,

Fill me with Thy wonderful Spirit,
Come in and take full control.

Weary and sick with sin,

Back to His fold again.

Oh, the grace that brought me to the fold,
G7          C          G         D7      G
Wondrous grace that brought me to the fold!

He washed the bleeding sin-wounds,
And poured in oil and wine;
He whispered to assure me,
“I’ve found thee; thou art Mine.”
I never heard a sweeter voice;
It made my aching heart rejoice!

He pointed to the nail-prints;
For me His blood was shed;
A mocking crown so thorny
Was placed upon His head:

I wondered what He saw in me
To suffer such deep agony.

I’m sitting in His presence,
The sunshine of His face,
While with adoring wonder
His blessings I retrace.
It seems as if eternal days
Are far too short to sound His praise.

So while the hours are passing,
All now is perfect rest;
I’m waiting for the morning,
The brightest and the best,
When He will call us to His side,
To be with Him, His spotless bride.

              A                     D
I’m not ashamed His name to bear;

I’ll tell the world that I’m a Christian –

I’ll take Him with me anywhere.
              Bm                F#m
I’ll tell the world how Jesus saved me,
                  G                     D
And how He gave me a life brand-new;

My life, my all is His forever,
                           A    D
And where He leads me, I will go.

I’ll tell the world that He is coming –
It may be near or far away;
But we must live as if His coming
Would be tomorrow or today.
For when He comes and life is over,
For those who love Him there’s more to be;
Eyes have never seen the wonders
That He’s preparing for you and me.
O tell the world that you’re a Christian,
Be not ashamed His name to bear;
O tell the world that you’re a Christian,
And take Him with you everywhere.

In the book of Thy kingdom, is my name written there?

Chorus for last stanza
Yes, my name’s written there on the page white and fair;
In the book of Thy kingdom, yes, my name’s written there!

Lord, my sins they are many, like the sands of the sea,
But Thy blood, O my Saviour, is sufficient for me;
For Thy promise is written in bright letters that glow,
“Though your sins be as scarlet, I will make them like snow.”

O that beautiful city with its mansions of light,
With its glorified beings in pure garments of white;
Where no evil thing cometh to despoil what is fair,
Where the angels are watching – yes, my name’s written there.

Sing it softly through the gloom,
When the heart for mercy craves;
Sing in triumph o'er the tomb –
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

Give the winds a mighty voice,

Let the nations now rejoice –
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Shout salvation full and free,
Highest hills and deepest caves;
This our song of victory –
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

There was a time when man was near to God,

That was the time when man and beast could walk

In the garden that God had made,
                  Em              B7
But man have sinned, the Bible says,

There came a time for God’s redemption plan,
He sent His Son down to this sin-sick land.
On the cross He bled and died
To bring us back right on God’s side.
He is a friend who loves right to the end.
Today Christ lives again,
Saved me from death and shame
Life to me now has new meaning.
I pray that day by day,
By faith I’ll walk your way,
Until I see You face to face.

Everybody ought to know.

On the cross He died for sinners,
And His blood makes white as snow;
Loving, living, coming Saviour -
He’s the one you ought to know.

I love Jesus, hallelujah!
I love Jesus, yes I do;
I love Jesus, He’s my Saviour,
Jesus smiles and loves me too.

Just now throw open the door –

Let Jesus come into your heart.

If ’tis for purity now that you sigh,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
Fountains for cleansing are flowing nearby,
Let Jesus come into your heart.

If there’s a tempest your voice cannot still,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
If there’s a void this world never can fill,
Let Jesus come into your heart.

If you would join the glad songs of the blest,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
If you would enter the mansions of rest,
Let Jesus come into your heart.

Must I go, and empty-handed,
Dm                G7       C
Thus my dear Redeemer meet?
                F       C
Not one day of service give Him,

Lay no trophy at His feet?

Chorus:

Must I go, and empty-handed?
Am      D7      G       G7
Must I meet my Saviour so?
C                  F        C
Not one soul with which to greet Him –
F       C      G7     C
Must I empty-handed go?

Not at death I shrink nor falter,
For my Saviour saves me now;
But to meet Him empty-handed,
Thought of that now clouds my brow.

O the years in sinning wasted!
Could I but recall them now,
I would give them to my Saviour –
To His will I’d gladly bow.

O ye saints, arouse, be earnest,
Up and work while yet ’tis day;
Ere the night of death o’er-take thee,
Strive for souls while still you may.

O Zion, haste, thy mission high fulfilling,
D          A        E                A
To tell to all the world that God is Light;

That He who made all nations is not willing

One soul should perish, lost in shades of night.

Chorus:

Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
F#         Bm D          A          E   A
Tidings of Je – sus, redemption, and release.

Behold how many thousands still are lying,
Bound in the darksome prison house of sin,
With none to tell them of the Saviour’s dying,
Or of the life He died for them to win.

Proclaim to ev’ry people, tongue, and nation
That God, in whom they live and move, is love:
Tell how he stooped to save His lost creation,
And died on earth that man might live above.

Give of thy sons to bear the message glorious;
Give of thy wealth to speed them on their way;
Pour out thy soul for them in prayer victorious;
And all thou spendest Jesus will repay.

Not for the years of time alone,

But for e-ter-ni-ty.

Once I was lost in sin’s degradation;
Jesus came down to bring me salvation,
Lifted me up from sorrow and shame;
Now I belong to Him.

Joy floods my soul, for Jesus has saved me,
Freed me from sin that long had enslaved me;
His precious blood He gave to redeem;
Now I belong to Him.

I can be a little missionary,

I can work for Jesus in the homeland
G                 A      D
“Lord, here am I, send me.”

I don’t have to cross the salty ocean,
To the needy heathen to show my devotion;
I can pray and give to send the others,
Who’ll represent me there.

I’ll be faithful, studying and praying,
If the Master calls me, home I’ll not be staying;
To the fields “already white to harvest,”
“Send me, O Lord,” I’ll pray.

“I am the Way,”
Christ speaks a solemn Word.
“I am the Way, the Truth, the Life,
The only way to God.

Be born again –
Test of your salvation!
Except a man be born again,
How shall he enter heaven?

Come unto Me,
Ye heavy laden ones.
Come unto Me without delay,
And I will give you rest!

I give you peace,
My peace I give to you.
Not as the world below giveth,
My peace I leave with you.”

I now repent with bitter tears:
Lord, I’m coming home.

I’m tired of sin and straying, Lord:
Now I’m coming home;
I’ll trust Thy love, believe Thy word;

My soul is sick, my heart is sore:
Now I’m coming home;
My strength renew, my hope restore:

     A                     D
Until the Saviour came in;
                 G       D
His precious blood, I know,
         A                  D
Has washed it white as snow.
       A                D
And in His Word I’m told
      A                 D
I’ll walk the street of gold;
                 G          D
O wonderful, wonderful day –
       A                 D
He washed my sins away!

A new life God gave to me –
New life, abundant and free;
He wants this new life to grow,
The Bible tells me so.
By loving, trusting and praying,
By witnessing and obeying,
I’ll grow in God’s knowledge and grace
Until I look on His face.

Redeemed, how I love to proclaim it,
      D                       G
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;

Redeemed, redeemed,

His child, and forever, I am.

Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.

I think of my blessèd Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long;
I sing, for I cannot be silent;
His love is the theme of my song.

I know I shall see in His beauty
The King in whose law I delight;
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night.

Wash me, cleanse me in the blood That flowed on Calvary.

Though coming weak and vile,
Thou dost my strength assure;
Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse,
Till spotless all and pure.

'Tis Jesus calls me on
To perfect faith and love,
To perfect hope and peace and trust,
For earth and heav'n above.

'Tis Jesus who confirms
The blessed work within,
By adding grace to welcomed grace,
Where reigned the pow’r of sin.

All hail, atoning blood!
All hail, redeeming grace!
All hail, the gift of Christ our Lord,
Our strength and righteousness.

Ye Christian soldiers, rise,
                        A
And press the battle ere the night
                           D
Shall veil the glowing skies.
   A                 D
Against the foe in vales below
    A          E          A
Let all our strength be hurled;

Faith is the vic-to-ry, we know
     D       A          D
That overcomes the world.

Faith is the victory! Faith is the victory!
G              D             A              D
Oh, glorious victory, That overcomes the world.

His banner over us is love,
Our sword the Word of God;
We tread the road the saints above
With shouts of triumph trod.
By faith they like a whirlwind’s breath
Swept on o’er ev’ry field;

On ev’ry hand the foe we find
Drawn up in dread array;
Let tents of ease be left behind,

And onward to the fray!
Salvation’s helmet on each head,
With truth all grit about:
The earth shall tremble ‘neath our tread
And echo with our shout.

To him that overcomes the foe
White raiment shall be giv’n:
Before the angles he shall know
His name confessed in heav’n.
Then onward from the hills of light,
Our hearts with love aflame;
We’ll vanquish all the hosts of night
In Jesus’ conq’ring name.

You said you’d come and share all my sorrows,

You said you’d be there for all my tomorrows.
D           D7       G            A
I came so close to sending you away,
     D            Bm             G            A
But just like you promised, you came here to stay.
               D
I just had to pray.

Chorus:
       D7
And Jesus said,
  G              A       D         Bm
"Come to the water, stand by my side
    A                        D
I know you are thirsty, you won’t be denied
  D7          G                               D
I felt every tear drop, when in darkness you cried
         Bm         Em A
And I strove to remind you,
           A            D
It’s for those tears I died"

Your goodness so great, I can’t understand it
And dear Lord I know now that all this was planned
I know You’re here now and always will be
Your love loosened my chains, and in You I’m free
But Jesus why me?

Jesus I give You, my heart and my soul
I know now without God, I'll never be whole
Saviour, You opened all the right doors
And I thank You and praise You from earth's humble shores
Take me I’m Yours!

Only a boy called David,

Five little stones he took.

Dare to stand alone for Christ,

Claim the blood He sacrificed;

Lift the name of Jesus high,

Press onward to the sky.

We are marching toward our goal,
All the world before us lies;
With our Captain we shall endure,
Till we gain the heav’nly prize.

Join us, Camper, and take your stand,
Daily feast upon His Word;
Face the foe with your sword in hand,
Till the vict’ry shout is heard.

Though pressed by many a foe,
      G D7 G             G7      C
That will not tremble on the brink
   G D7          G
Of any earthly woe;

That will not murmur nor complain
Beneath the chast’ning rod,
But in the hour of grief or pain
Will lean upon its God.

A faith that shines more bright and clear
When tempests rage without,
That, when in danger, knows no fear,
In darkness feels no doubt.

Lord, give me such a faith as this,
And then, whate’er may come,
I’ll taste e’en now the hallowed bliss
Of an eternal home.

Ask of thy God and receive.

Never give up to thy sorrows, Jesus will bid them depart;
G                   C            B7
Trust in the Lord, trust in the Lord,
Am                            G                  D7             G
Sing when your trials are greatest, trust in the Lord and take heart.

What if thy burdens oppress thee;
What though thy life may be drear;
Look on the side that is brightest,
Pray, and thy path will be clear.

Never be sad or desponding,
There is a morrow for thee;
Soon thou shalt dwell in its brightness,
There with the Lord thou shalt be.

Never be sad or desponding,
Lean on the arm of thy Lord;
Dwell in the depths of His mercy,
Thou shalt receive thy reward.

Thou Lamb of Calvary, Saviour divine!
D
Now hear me while I pray; take all my guilt away;
G          D               A       D
O let me from this day be wholly Thine!

May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart, my zeal inspire;
As Thou hast died for me, O may my love to Thee
Pure warm, and changeless be, a living fire.

While life’s dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread, be Thou my guide;
Bid darkness turn to day, wipe sorrow’s tears away,
Nor let me ever stray from Thee aside.

When ends life’s transient dream,
When death’s cold sullen stream shall o’er me roll;
Blest Savior, then, in love, fear and distrust remove;
O bear me safe above, a ransomed soul.

All power in earth, all power above,
             D             A          D
Is given to Him for the flock of His love.

Chorus:

Only believe, only believe;

All things are possible, only believe.

Fear not, little flock, He goeth ahead,
Your Shepherd selecteth the path you must tread;
The waters of Marah He’ll sweeten for thee –
He drank all the bitter in Gethsemane.

Fear not, little flock, whatever your lot;
He enters all rooms, the doors being shut.
He never forsakes, He never is gone –
So count on His presence in darkness and dawn.

   C
I know not why God’s wondrous grace
                      G7
To me He hath made known,
     C
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
     G7               C C7
Redeemed me for His own.

Chorus:
        F                  C
But I know whom I have believed,
           G7                C    C7
And am persuaded that He is able
      F                    C
To keep that which I’ve committed
       G7              C
Unto Him against that day.

I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His Word
Wrought peace within my heart.

I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus through the Word,
Creating faith in Him.

I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me –
Of weary ways or golden days
Before His face I see.

I know not when my Lord my come,
At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I’ll walk the vale with Him,
Or meet Him in the air.

So as I face tomorrow

With its problems large and small,

Give to Him my all.

Keep on believing, this is the way,

Faith in the night as well as the day.

If all were easy, if all were bright,
Where would the cross be? And where the fight?
But in the testings God gives to you,
Chances for proving what He can do.

God is your wisdom; God is your might;
God’s ever near you guiding you right;
He understands you, knows all you need:
Trusting in Him you’ll surely succeed.

Let us press on then; never despair;
Live above feeling, victory’s there;
Jesus can keep us so near to Him,
That nevermore shall our faith grow dim.

For me He died, for me He lives,

And everlasting life and light He freely gives.

No merit of my own his anger to suppress.
My only hope is found in Jesus’ righteousness.

And now for me He stands before the Father’s throne.
He shows His wounded hands and names me as His own.

His grace has planned it all, ‘Tis mine but to believe,
And recognize His work of love and Christ receive.

By joining Daniel’s band!

Many giants great and tall,
Stalking through the land,
Headlong to the earth would fall,
If met by Daniel’s band!

Hold the gospel banner high!
On to vict’ry grand!
Satan and his host defy,
And shout for Daniel’s band!

It may be in the valley, where countless danger hide;
                                 G D7         G
It may be in the sunshine that I in peace abide;
                                C
But this one thing I know – if it be dark or fair,
    F        C            G7       C
If Jesus is with me, I’ll go anywhere!

Chorus:
    C                              G
If Jesus goes with me, I’ll go anywhere!
                                               G7 C
‘Tis heaven to me, where’er I may be, if He is there!
                                       C7 F
 I count it a privilege here His cross to bear;
                             C G C
If Jesus goes with me, I’ll go anywhere.

It may be I must carry the blessed word of life
Across the burning deserts to those in sinful strife;
And though it be my lot to bear my colours there,
If Jesus goes with me, I’ll go anywhere!

But if it be my portion to bear my cross at home,
While others bear their burdens beyond the billows’ foam,
I’ll prove my faith in Him – confess His judgements fair,
And, if He stays with me, I’ll stay anywhere!

It is not mine to question the judgments of my Lord,
It is but mine to follow the leadings of His Word;
But if to go or stay, or whether here or there,
I’ll be, with my Saviour, content anywhere!

O Lord, my heart I give Thee. My innermost thoughts are Thine.
     D         D7           G                      A7    D
My lips shall praise Thee freely, abounding with joy divine!

Upon Thy radiant glo - ry my eyes shall fix their gaze:

O let me e - ver tarry and ever stand here, amazed!

Thou art the King, eternal, the only wise God of all,
Beheld by every angel whoever before Thee fall.
In love and deep contrition to Thy great throne I draw:
And bow in whole submission, enraptured and filled with awe.

Thou hast become my portion, my fortress, my rock and shield,
The fount of my salvation, my surety, hope and seal!
In Thee is boundless treasure: an endless fount of grace,
All blessings without measure abide in Thy Holy Place!

My heart shall wait upon Thee to pour Thy refreshing streams;
In quietness I seek Thee, if Thou would but send a beam!
Without Thee, I would perish, my heart would have no rest.
O how my soul doth cherish by Thy face to be blest!

   D           D7       G
A pilgrim was I and awand’ring,
        A                       D
In the cold night of sin I did roam,
                   D7                G
When Jesus the kind Shepherd found me,
      D         A              D
And now I am on my way home.

Chorus:
         D
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
         A            A7           D
All the days, all the days of my life;
          D
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
         A             A7        D
All the days, all the days of my life.

To be sung after last chorus
              G                         D
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever,
            Bm           E                A A7
And I shall feast at the table spread for me;
          D
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
        A              A7           D
All the days, all the days of my life,
        Em             A          D
All the days, all the days of my life.

He restoreth my soul when I’m weary,
He giveth me strength day by day;
He leads me beside the still waters,
He guards me each step of the way.

When I walk through the dark lonesome valley,
My Saviour will walk with me there;
And safely His great hand will lead me
To the mansions He’s gone to prepare.

      C       G         Am      Em
Unbounded grace- it reached to me
        F        C           G G7
When hope was gone from view;
   C      G           Am     Em
In my despair, Christ came to me
    F    G7        C
As He alone could do.

Grace was for me the only way
My guilt could find relief;
My destiny was changed that day
I reached out in belief.

God's grace does not on me depend-
It's God who is my Stay;
His love is offered without end,
He walks with me each day.

The universe with joy will ring
When grace has won the day;
As all creation joins to sing,
Praise God who paid man's way!

      G                          C           G
The mercies of God! What a theme for my song,
     A                           D D7
O! I never could number them o'er;
         G             G7           C
They're more than the stars in the heavenly dome,
        G           D              G    G7
Or the sands of the wave-beaten shore.

Chorus:
        C                          G
For mercies so great, what return can I make?
        A7                         D      D7
For mercies so constant and sure?
      G              G7            C           G
I'll love him, I'll serve Him with all that I have
                    D          G
As long as my life shall endure.

They greet me at morn when I waken from sleep,
And they gladden my heart at the noon;
They follow me on into shades of the night,
When the day with its labour is done.

His angels of mercy encompass me round,
Wheresoever my pathway my lead;
Each turn of the road some new token reveals,
O! For me life is blessed indeed.

His goodness and mercy will follow me still,
Even on to the end of the way;
I have His sure promise and that cannot fail,
That His mercy is mine every day.

Sweetly the Light has dawned upon me;

Once I was blind, but now I can see:
    E                      B7 E
The Light of the world is Jesus.

No darkness have we who in Jesus abide;
The Light of the world is Jesus!
We walk in the Light when we follow our Guide;
The Light of the world is Jesus!

Ye dwellers in darkness with sin blinded eyes,
The Light of the world is Jesus!
Go wash at His bidding and light will arise;
The Light of the world is Jesus!

No need of the sunlight in heaven, we’re told;
The Light of the world is Jesus!
The Lamb is the Light in the city of gold,
The Light of the world is Jesus!

Naught have I gotten but what I received,

Grace hath bestowed it since I have believed;

Boasting excluded, pride I abase –
    G      C       G7       C
I’m only a sinner saved by grace!

Chorus:

Only a sinner saved by grace!

This is my story, to God be the glory –
    F      C       G7        C
I’m only a sinner saved by grace!

Once I was foolish, and sin ruled my heart,
Causing my footsteps from God to depart;
Jesus hath found me, happy my case –
I now am a sinner saved by grace!

Tears unavailing, no merit had I,
Mercy had saved me or else I must die;
Sin had alarmed me, fearing God’s face –
But now I’m a sinner saved by grace!

Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows,
Loving His Saviour, to tell what he knows;
Once more to tell it would I embrace –
I’m only a sinner saved by grace!

And a joy this world could not afford

Since I yielded control of my body and soul

To my wonderful, wonderful Lord.

Chorus:

By angels and seraphs in heaven adored!

I know Thou art mine, my Savior divine,
     E          B7        E
My wonderful, wonderful Lord.

I desire that my life shall be ordered by Thee
That my will be in perfect accord –
With Thine own sov'reign will
Thy desires to fulfill.

All the talents I have – I have laid at Thy feet
Thy approval shall be my reward.
Be my store great or small, I surrender it all
To my wonderful, wonderful Lord.

Thou art fairer to me than the fairest of earth
Thou omnipotent, life-giving Word
O Thou Ancient of Days, Thou art worthy all praise,
My wonderful, wonderful Lord.

Urged and inspired us, cheered us on our way,

Sought us and saved us, pardoned and provided:

Lord for the years, we bring our thanks today.

Lord, for that word, the word of life which fires us,
Speaks to our hearts and sets our souls ablaze,
Teaches and trains, rebukes us and inspires us:
Lord of the word, receive your people's praise.

Lord, for our land in this our generation,
Spirits oppressed by pleasure, wealth and care:
For young and old, for commonwealth and nation,
Lord of our land, be pleased to hear our prayer.

Lord, for our world where men disown and doubt you,
Loveless in strength, and comfortless in pain,
Hungry and helpless, lost indeed without you:
Lord of the world, we pray that Christ may reign.

Lord for ourselves; in living pow’r remake us –
Self on the cross, and Christ upon the throne,
Past put behind us, for the future take us:
Lord of our lives, to live for Christ alone.

Do not pass me by.

Let me at Thy throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.

Trusting only in Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

Thou the spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me,
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heav’n but Thee?

He can't be seen, but He is there it's true.
He is your friend, He'll keep you in His care.
He goes with you ev'rywhere.

       D       A               D
My Lord has garments so wondrous fine,
        G                  A
And myrrh their texture fills;
     D          A7               D     F#m
Its fragrance reached to this heart of mine,
Em D         A7     D
With joy my being thrills.

Chorus:
                 A7
Out of the ivory palaces,
Em      A       D
Into a world of woe,
                 C#     F#m Em
Only His great, eternal love
D          A7      D
Made my Saviour go.

His life had also its sorrows sore,
For aloes had a part;
And when I think of the cross He bore,
My eyes with teardrops start.

His garments too were in cassia dipped,
With healing in a touch;
Each time my feet in some sin have slipped,
He took me from its clutch.

In garments glorious He will come,
To open wide the door;
And I shall enter my heav’nly home,
To dwell forevermore.

419 (6/8 Dmaj)

He sendeth more strength when the labors increase.
             D7           G           D
To added affliction He addeth His mercy;
                           A          D
To multiplied trials, His multiplied peace.

Chorus:
      A          A7           D          D7
His love has no limit, His grace has no measure,
     G                           D        A
His pow’r has no boundary known unto men;
     D        D7         G
For out of His infinite riches in Jesus,
    D            B7           Em A D
He giveth, and giveth, and giveth again!

When we have exhausted our store of endurance,
When our strength has failed ere the day is half done,
When we reach the end of our hoarded resources,
Our Father’s full giving is only begun.

Everlasting life-giving stream.

Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured,
Am                             G     D G
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.

Chorus:
G                C     G
Grace, grace, God's grace,
D7                            G
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within;
G                C     G
Grace, grace, God's grace,
Am                         D       G
Grace that is greater than all our sin.

Dark is the stain that we cannot hide,
What can avail to wash it away?
Look! There is flowing a crimson tide;
Whiter than snow you may be today.

Marvellous, infinite, matchless grace,
Freely bestowed on all who believe;
You that are longing to see His face,
Will you this moment His grace receive?

In His kingdom above, by life’s waters so pure,
When this life with its trials is past.

In searching for Your way and wisdom, teach me if You would,
      C               F               Dm G7 C
That for all time, in ev’ry place, my God is good.

How can You give pardon to a life that’s full of sin?
Where is there a refuge from my cares?
Is there any healing for a void that lies within,
When silence is Your answer to my prayers?

Along the road of life, I have a Friend divine
                 C                          G7
Who walks with me and gently leads the way;

O’er mountain steep, through valley dark and cold;

It is enough to know He travels by my side
             C      Dm         G7        C
Along the road that leads to streets of gold!

For many years, I did not know His love so true
Until I heard how on the cross He died;
I trusted Him and He became my Saviour too,
And since that day, He’s journeyed by my side.

Jesus, my Saviour, to Bethlehem came,
 G        Em         A7            D
Born in a manger to sorrow and shame;

Jesus, my Saviour, on Calvary’s tree,
Paid the great debt, and my soul He set free;
Oh it was wonderful—how could it be!
Dying for me, for me!
Dying for me, for me! Dying for me, for me!
Oh it was wonderful—how could it be!
Dying for me, for me!

Jesus, my Saviour, the same as of old,
When I was wand’ring afar from the fold,
Gently and long did He plead with my soul,
Calling for me, for me!
Calling for me, for me! Calling for me, for me!
Gently and long did He plead with my soul,
Calling for me, for me!

Jesus, my Saviour, shall come from on high--
Sweet is the promise as weary years fly;
Oh I shall see Him descend from the sky,

Coming for me, for me!
Coming for me, for me! Coming for me, for me!
Oh I shall see Him descend from the sky,
Coming for me, for me!

No harm can befall with my Comforter near,
No harm can befall with my Comforter near.

In the midst of affliction my table is spread,
With blessings unmeasured my cup runneth o’er;
With perfume and oil Thou anointest my head;

Let goodness and mercy, my bountiful God,
Still follow my steps till I meet Thee above;

Through land of their sojourn, Thy Kingdom of love,
Through land of their sojourn, Thy Kingdom of love.

No evil can betide thee.

Be not afraid for the terror of midnight,
Nor for the arrow that hasteth to slay;
Fear not the pestilence walking in darkness,
Nor the destroyer that wasteth by day.

Seek the Most High for thy sure habitation,
Unto Jehovah for refuge now fly;
There shall no evil befall thee nor harm thee,
Unto thy dwelling no plague shall come nigh.

Love thou the Lord, surely he will deliver;
He will exalt thee and answer thy prayer;
He will be with thee to honor and give thee
Life without end, his salvation to share.

O Lord, I cannot see; grant me Thy light;
Darkness bewilders me, clouding my sight;
Hold Thou my hand, and keep close by my side:
I dare not go alone; be Thou my guide.

I cannot see Thy face, yet Thou art here;
When will the morning chase my doubts and fear?
When shall I see the place where day and night
Shall come not, for Thy glory is … its light?

I will be patient, Lord, and do Thy will;
I will not doubt Thy word, my hopes fulfil.
How can I perish, if in Thee I hide;

Wait, I say, wait on the Lord.

Be not weary in waiting, for love suffers long;
If you faint not, you’ll reap when the harvest is come.
Run with patience the race as you rest on His Word,
For your testing will teach you to wait on the Lord.

In paths of truth and grace.

When I walk through the shades of death
Thy presence is my stay;
One word of Thy supporting breath
Drives all my fears away.
Thy hand, in sight of all my foes,
Doth still my table spread;
My cup with blessings overflows,
Thine oil anoints my head.

The sure provisions of my God
Attend me all my days;
O may Thy house be my abode,
And all my work be praise.
There would I find a settled rest,
While others go and come;
No more a stranger, nor a guest,
But like a child at home.

The moment when He first created man.

The mountains and the lees, the deserts and the seas
Were made with utmost care from pole to pole.
And in my heart, I know it surely must be so
He has a plan and pattern for my soul;
Why am I here? The reason is so clear.
He made me and He claimed this life of mine.
His life to me He gave, I’m a sinner saved by grace;
My destiny is in His will divine.

God makes no mistakes; His way is best.

When the toils of life are come and my heart is worn with care,
I faint ‘neath the burden of a cross I cannot bear.
When the joy has departed from my sorrow-stricken soul,
This one thing I know for sure: my God is in control.

“Let not your heart be troubled,” His tender Word I hear,
And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubt and fears;
Though by the path He leadeth but one step I may see:
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

Whenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise,
When songs give place to sighing, when hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to Him, from care He sets me free;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He cares for me.
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He cares for me.

C                     F
He leadeth me, O blessed thought!

O words with heav’nly comfort fraught!

Whate’er I do, where’er I be,

Still ’tis God’s hand that leadeth me.

Chorus:

He leadeth me! He leadeth me!
               Am         C      G
By His own hand He leadeth me;
     C        G       F        C
His faithful foll’wer I would be,
              Am         G7     C
For by His hand He leadeth me.

Sometimes ’mid scenes of deepest gloom,
Sometimes where Eden’s bowers bloom,
By waters still, o’er troubled sea,
Still ’tis His hand that leadeth me.

Lord, I would place my hand in Thine,
Nor ever murmur nor repine;
Content, whatever lot I see,
Since ’tis my God that leadeth me.

And when my task on earth is done,
When by Thy grace the vict’ry’s won,
E’en death’s cold wave I will not flee,
Since God through Jordan leadeth me.

      D          F#m          G           A   D
Our God is far greater than words can make known,
              F#m       G               A
Exalted and holy, He reigns on His throne,
   G          D          F#m        G
In infinite splendour He rules over all;
           D            F#m                 G      A D
Yet He feeds the poor sparrows, and He knows when they fall.

Chorus:

His power is great and will ever endure,

His wisdom is peaceable, gentle and pure.

But greater than all these glories I see,
        D      F#m           G          A D
Is the glorious promise that He cares for me.

The earth and the heav’ns are the work of His hands,
And billions of angels obey His commands.
He guides the great galaxies spinning through space,
Yet He gave us His Son as a gift of His grace.

He rides the wild heavens, He strides through the seas;
The high mountains tremble to hear His decrees.
His voice with great thunderings sounds from above,
But to His own children, He whispers His love.

Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,

Pilgrim through this barren land;

I am weak, but Thou art mighty;
G          C       D7        G
Hold me with Thy pow’rful hand;

Bread of Heaven, Bread of Heaven,
                        D
Feed me till I want no more,
G            C D7       G
Feed me till I want no more.

Open now the crystal fountain,
Whence the healing stream doth flow;
Let the fire and cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through;
Strong Deliv’rer, strong Deliv’rer,
Be Thou still my strength and shield,
Be Thou still my strength and shield.

When I tread the verge of Jordan,
Bid my anxious fears subside;
Death of death, and hell’s destruction,
Land me safe on Canaan’s side;
Songs of praises, songs of praises
I will ever give to Thee,
I will ever give to Thee.

God hath not promised skies always blue,

Flow-er strewn pathways all our lives through;

Rest for the labour, light for the way,

Grace for the trials, help from above,
G7        C           D         G
Unfailing sympathy, undying love.

God hath not promised we shall not know
Toil and temptation, trouble and woe;
He hath not told us we shall not bear
Many a burden, many a care.

God hath not promised smooth roads and wide,
Swift, easy travel, needing no guide;
Never a mountain rocky and steep,
Never a river turbid and deep.

From the sea formed the clouds,

We will tell the story how we've overcome;

We will understand it better by and by.

Oft our cherished plans have failed,
Disappointments have prevailed,
And we've wandered in the darkness,
Heavy-hearted and alone;
But we're trusting in the Lord,
And according to His Word,
We will understand it better by and by.

Temptations, hidden snares
Often take us unawares,
And our hearts are made to bleed
For some thoughtless word or deed,
And we wonder why the test
When we try to do our best,
But we'll understand it better by and by.

Beyond the sunset a hand will guide me
To God, the Father, whom I adore;
His glorious presence, His words of welcome,

Beyond the sunset, O glad reunion,
With our dear loved ones who’ve gone before;
In that fair homeland we’ll know no parting,
Beyond the sunset for evermore!

A thousand sacred sweets
Before we reach the heav’nly fields,
Before we reach the heav’nly fields,

Or walk the golden streets,
Or walk the golden streets.

Then let our songs abound,
And every tear be dry;

We’re marching through Immanuel’s ground,
To fairer worlds on high,

Their songs of sweetest praise drifts back from heaven's shore,
And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.

They're all expecting me and that's one thing I know,
My Saviour’s pardoned me and now I onward go;
I know He'll take me through though I am weak and poor,

Not a shadow, not a sigh.

Let us then, be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving every day;
Just one glimpse of Him in glory
Will the toils of earth repay.

Onward to the prize before us!
Soon His beauty we’ll behold;
Soon the pearly gates will open,
We shall tread the streets of gold.

Every step is getting brighter
As the golden stairs I climb;
Every burden’s getting lighter,
Every cloud is silver-lined.
There the sun is always shining,
There no tear will dim the eye;
At the ending of the rainbow,
Where the mountains touch the sky.

I don’t know about tomorrow,
It may bring me poverty;
But the One who feeds the sparrow,
Is the One who stands by me.
And the path that is my portion,
May be through the flame or flood;
But His presence goes before me,
And I’m covered with His blood.

F        G         C Am        F         G7        C Am
I know where I’m go-ing and whom I’m goin’ to see;
   Dm       G          Em Am Dm         G7        C C7
I have a friend named Je-sus waiting there for me!
F        G        C Am        F G7              C Am
He can give life meaning that only He could give,
    Dm        G7 Em Am Dm            G        C
He gave His life in pay-ment so that I could live.

There are many mansions He’s preparing there,
That could not be purchased by a millionaire;
Streets of gold that glitter, gates of pearly white,
In a day eternal where there is no night.

Friend, if you are searching for a better way,
I’m recommending Jesus – trust in Him today;
He will give life meaning like no other can,
Come and travel with me to the promised land.

G        D                 G
Love divine, so great and wondrous,
C          G                 D
Deep and mighty, pure, sublime;
G                         C
Coming from the heart of Jesus --
          G            D7       G
Just the same through tests of time.

Chorus:
D                        G
He the pearly gates will open,
C       G           D
So that I may enter in;
G                         C
For He purchased my redemption
          G      D7     G
And forgave me all my sin.

Like a sparrow hunted, frightened,
Weak and helpless -- such was I;
Wounded, fallen, yet He healed me --
He will heed the sinner’s cry.

Love divine, so great and wondrous!
All my sins He then forgave;
I will sing His praise forever,
For His blood, His pow’r to save.

In life’s even-tide, at twilight,
At His door I’ll knock and wait;
By the precious love of Jesus
I shall enter heaven’s gate.

      G                C
I am dwelling on the mountain,
            G      C        D
Where the golden sunlight gleams,
        G                  C
O’er a land of wondrous beauty,
        G         C       G
Far exceeds my fondest dreams;
            G
Where the air is pure, ethereal,

Laden with the breath of flowers,
                            C
They are blooming by the fountain,
           G C           G
‘Neath the amaranthine bowers.

Chorus:
G
Is not this the land of Beulah,
             G
Blessed, blessed land of light,
                              C
Where the flowers bloom forever,
           G      C       G
And the sun is always bright?

I can see far down the mountain,
Where I wandered weary years,
Often hindered in my journey
By the ghosts of doubts and fears,
Broken vows and disappointments
Thickly sprinkled all the way;
But the Spirit led unerring
To the land I hold today.

I am drinking at the fountain,
Where I ever would abide,
For I’ve tasted life’s pure river,
And my soul is satisfied;
There’s no thirsting for life’s pleasures,
Nor adorning rich and gay,
For I’ve found a richer treasure,
One that fadeth not away.

Tell me not of heavy crosses,
Nor the burdens hard to bear,
For I’ve found this great salvation
Makes each burden light appear;
And I love to follow Jesus,
Gladly counting all but dross,
Worldly honors all forsaking
For the glory of the cross.

Oh, the cross has wondrous glory!
Oft I’ve proved this to be true,
When I’m in the way so narrow,
I can see a pathway through;
And how sweetly Jesus whispers,
“Take the cross, thou need’st not fear,
For I’ve trod the way before thee,
And the glory lingers near.”

On the happy, golden shore where the faithful part no more,
            G                     D        A
When the storms of life are o’er, meet me there;

Where the night dissolves away into pure and perfect day,

Meet me there, meet me there,

Where the tree of life is blooming, meet me there.

When the storms of life are o'er, on the happy golden shore,
           D                       A7       D
Where the faithful part no more, meet me there.

Here our fondest hopes are vain; dearest links are rent in twain;
But in heav'n no throb of pain – meet me there;
By the river sparkling bright, in the city of delight,
Where our faith is lost in sight, meet me there.

Where the harps of angels ring, and the blest forever sing,
In the palace of the King, meet me there;
Where in sweet communion blend heart with heart and friend
with friend,
In a world that has no end, meet me there.

Face to face, in all His glory,
         A       E       A
I shall see Him by and by!

Only faintly now I see Him,
With the darkling veil between;
But a blessed day is coming,
When His glory shall be seen.

What rejoicing in His presence,
When are banished grief and pain,
When the crooked ways are straightened
And the dark things shall be plain.

Face to face – O blissful moment!
Face to face – to see and know;
Face to face with my Redeemer,
Jesus Christ who loves me so!

I'm feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,

For I am dwelling in Beulah Land.

Far below the storm of doubt upon the world is beating,
Sons of men in battle long the enemy withstand:
Safe am I within the castle of God's word retreating,
Nothing then can reach me tis Beulah Land.

Let the stormy breezes blow, their cry cannot alarm me;
I am safely sheltered here, protected by God's hand:
Here the sun is always shining, here there's naught can harm me,
I am safe forever in Beulah Land.

Viewing here the works of God, I sink in contemplation,
Hearing now His blessed voice, I see the way He planned:
Dwelling in the Spirit, here I learn of full salvation,
Gladly will I tarry in Beulah Land.

Spend much time in secret with Jesus alone;

Thy friends in thy conduct His likeness shall see.

Take time to be holy, let Him be thy Guide;
And run not before Him, whatever betide;
In joy or in sorrow, still follow the Lord,
And, looking to Jesus, still trust in His Word.

Take time to be holy, be calm in thy soul,
Each thought and each motive beneath His control;
Thus led by His Spirit to fountains of love,
Thou soon shalt be fitted for service above.

Salvation and peace have been brought
To those who have strayed afar.

Where’er my lot be cast, teach me Thy way!
Until the race is run, until the journey’s done,
Until the crown is won, teach me Thy way!

For more than conquerors we are!

Believe Him, and all will be well.
Then go to a world that is dying,
His perfect salvation to tell!

Bringing life and health and gladness
All around, this heav’nly Guest
Banished unbelief and sadness,
Changed our weariness to rest.

Like the rain that falls from heaven,
Like the sunlight from the sky,
So the Holy Ghost is given,
Coming on us from on high.

See, a fruitful field is growing,
Blessed fruit of righteousness;
And the streams of life are flowing
In the lonely wilderness.

What a wonderful salvation,
Where we always see His face!
What a perfect habitation,
What a quiet resting place!

So that men might live again in the image of God.

Now that I have believed and the Saviour received,
Now that I from the cry of my guilt am relieved,
I will live for my Lord, not for gain nor reward –
But for love, thinking of what His grace has restored!
I’ll never comprehend redemption’s plan –
How Christ could condescend to die for man.
Such a Saviour I’ll praise to the end of my days,
As I upward, onward trod in the image of God.

So shall I never die,
But live with Thee the perfect life
Of Thine eternity.

 Lead us to heaven, that we may share
 Fullness of joy for ever there;
 Lead us to God, our final rest,
 To be with him for ever blest.

To ev’ry captive soul a full deliv’rance brings;
And through the vacant cells the song of triumph rings:
The Comforter has come!

To wond’ring mortals tell the matchless grace divine
That I may with Him dwell, and in His image shine?
The Comforter has come!

While harvest fields are vast and white?
Revive us, Lord – the world is waiting!
Equip Thy Church to spread the light.

Where parents love the sacred Word
And all its wisdom prize.

This blessed peace to gain;
Unite our hearts in love to Thee,

A home by thee made happy, a love by thee kept true.

O Savior, Guest most bounteous of old in Galilee,
Vouchsafe today thy presence with these who call on thee;
Their store of earthly gladness transform to heavenly wine,
And teach them in the tasting, to know the gift is Thine.

O Spirit of the Father, breathe on them from above,
So mighty in Thy pureness, so tender in Thy love,
That, guarded by Thy presence, from sin and strife kept free,
Their lives may own Thy guidance, their hearts be ruled by Thee.

Except thou build it, Father, the house is built in vain;
Except thou, Savior, bless it, the joy will turn to pain;
But naught can break the union of hearts in Thee made one,
And love thy Spirit hallows is endless love begun.

Who always place their hope and trust in Him;
Whose tender patience turmoil never bothers,
Whose calm and courage trouble cannot dim;
A home where each finds joy in serving others,
And love still shines, tho' days be dark and grim.

O give us homes where Christ is Lord and Master,
The Bible read, the precious hymns still sung;
Where prayer comes first in peace or in disaster,
And praise is natural speech to ev'ry tongue;
Where mountains move before a faith that's vaster,
And Christ sufficient is for old and young.

O Lord, our God, our homes are Thine forever!
We trust to Thee their problems, toil and care;
Their bonds of love no enemy can sever
If Thou art always Lord and Master there:
Be Thou the center of our least endeavour-
Be Thou our Guest, our hearts and homes to share.

Was blind but now I see.

‘Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

Through many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come;
‘Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

Yes, when this heart and flesh shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess within the veil
A life of joy and peace.

When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we’d first begun.

In vain the firstborn seraph tries

’Tis mercy all! Let earth adore;

He left His Father’s throne above,
So free, so infinite His grace!
Humbled Himself in matchless love,
And bled for Adam’s helpless race.
‘Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me!
‘Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me!

Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature's night;
Thine eye diffused a quick'ning ray,
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my heart was free,
I rose went forth, and followed Thee.
My chains fell off, my heart was free,
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.

No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine;
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,
Bold I approach th’eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.
Bold I approach th’eternal throne,

His heart is touched with my grief;

When the days are weary, the long nights dreary,
   D        A       D
I know my Saviour cares.

Does Jesus care when my way is dark
With a nameless dread and fear?
As the daylight fades into deep night shades,
Does He care enough to be near?

Does Jesus care when I’ve tried and failed
To resist some temptation strong;
When in my deep grief I find no relief,
Though my tears flow all the night long?

Does Jesus care when I’ve said “goodbye”
To the dearest on earth to me,
And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks—
Is it aught to Him? Does He see?

The love of God is greater far
                  A            D
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;
            D
It goes beyond the highest star,
                A                  D
And reaches deep where sinners dwell.
      D7 G                        D
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
                 A     D
God gave His Son to win;
     D7     G            D
His erring child He reconciled,
                  A      D
And pardoned from his sin.

Chorus:
    D7       G               D
O love of God, how rich and pure!
                A       D
How measureless and strong!
    D7      G           D
It shall forevermore endure-
                  A7     D
The saints’ and angels’ song.

When hoary time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
When men who hear refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call;
God’s love, so pure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam’s race-
The saints’ and angels’ song.

Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made;
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;
To write the love of God, above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky.

Just to think that God loves me.

O, the wonder of it all! The wonder of it all!
        A          E          A
Just to think that God loves me.

There's the wonder of springtime and harvest,
The sky, the stars, the sun;
But the wonder of wonders that thrills my soul
Is a wonder that's only begun.

My cup runs over each day;
Your grace supplied me, now provides me

Bought my life with His great love,
Gave to me a peace this world could not afford.

Jesus loves me! He who died,
Heaven's gates to open wide;
He will wash away my sin,
That his child may enter in.

Jesus loves me, loves me still,
When I’m very weak and ill;
From His shining throne on high,
Watches o’er me where I lie.

Jesus loves me! He will stay
Close beside me all the way;
If I trust Him, when I die
He will take me home on high.

Though I forget Him and wander away,
Still He doth love me wherever I stray;
Back to His dear loving arms would I flee
When I remember that Jesus loves me.

Oh, if there’s only one song I can sing,
When in His beauty I see the great King,
This shall my song in eternity be:
“O what a wonder that Jesus loves me!”

For He loves the little children of the world;
And His cross I’ll always bear, and for Him I’ll do and dare,
For He loves the little children of the world.

Our needs supply and none deny.

If sometimes men can live for others,
And sometimes give where gifts are spurned;
If sometimes treat their foes as brothers,
And love where love is not returned.

If men will often share their gladness,
If men respond when children cry;
If men can feel each other’s sadness,
Each other’s tears attempt to dry.

How great Thou art, how great Thou art!

When through the woods and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze,

And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in –
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin!

When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!

Safe into the haven guide; O receive my soul at last!

Other refuge have I none; hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
Leave, ah! leave me not alone, still support and comfort me.
All my trust on Thee is stayed, all my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenseless head with the shadow of Thy wing.

Wilt Thou not regard my call? Wilt Thou not accept my prayer?
Lo! I sink, I faint, I fall! Lo, on Thee I cast my care!
Reach me out Thy gracious hand! While I of Thy strength receive,
Hoping against hope I stand, dying, and behold I live.

Thou, O Christ, art all I want; more than all in Thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint, heal the sick, and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy Name, I am all unrighteousness;
Vile and full of sin I am, Thou art full of truth and grace.

Plenteous grace with Thee is found, grace to cover all my sin;
Let the healing streams abound; make and keep me pure within.
Thou of life the fountain art, freely let me take of Thee;
Spring Thou up within my heart, rise to all eternity.

That theirs may be the love which knows no ending,

Whom Thou forevermore dost join in one.

O perfect Life, be Thou their full assurance
Of tender charity and steadfast faith,
Of patient hope and quiet, brave endurance,
With childlike trust that fears no pain nor death.

Grant them the joy which brightens earthly sorrow,
Grant them the peace which calms all earthly strife,
And to life’s day the glorious unknown morrow
That dawns upon eternal love and life.

While angels in His presence sang

Until the courts of heaven rang.

Chorus:

O the grace that brought me to the fold,
G           C           G         D      G
Wondrous grace that brought me to the fold!

He washed the bleeding sin-wounds
And poured in oil and wine;
He whispered to assure me,
"I've found thee, thou art Mine:"
I never heard a sweeter voice –
It made my aching heart rejoice!

He pointed to the nail-prints –
For me His blood was shed;
A mocking crown, so thorny,
Was placed upon His head;

I wondered what He saw in me,
To suffer such deep agony.

I'm sitting in His presence,
The sunshine of His face,
While with adoring wonder
His blessings I retrace;
It seems as if eternal days
Are far too short to sound His praise.

So while the hours are passing,
All now is perfect rest;
I'm waiting for the morning,
The brightest and the best,
When He will call us to His side
To be with Him, His spotless bride.

That in Thine ocean depths its flow may richer, fuller be.

O Light that follow’st all my way,
I yield my flick’ring torch to Thee;
My heart restores its borrowed ray,
That in Thy sunshine’s blaze its day may brighter, fairer be.

O Joy that seekest me through pain,
I cannot close my heart to Thee;
I trace the rainbow through the rain,
And feel the promise is not vain that morn shall tearless be.

O Cross that liftest up my head,
I dare not ask to fly from Thee;
I lay in dust life’s glory dead,
And from the ground there blossoms red life that shall endless be.

I would tell you how He changed my life completely,
          D                Bm                  A
He did something that no other friend could do.

Chorus:
                               D
No one ever cared for me like Jesus,
            A                      D
There’s no other friend so kind as He;
                            D7                G
No one else could take the sin and darkness from me,
D                 A7        D
O how much He cared for me.

All my life was full of sin when Jesus found me,
All my heart was full of misery and woe;
Jesus placed His strong and loving arms about me,
And He led me in the way I ought to go.

Ev’ry day He comes to me with new assurance,
More and more I understand His words of love;
But I’ll never know just why He came to save me,
Till some day I see His blessed face above.

520 (4/4 Gmaj)

   G
I stand amazed in the presence
    D             G
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
      C                     G
And wonder how He could love me,
             D            G
A sinner condemned, unclean.

Chorus:
G
How marvelous! How wonderful!
D
And my song shall ever be:
G
How marvelous! How wonderful
C     G          D7      G
Is my Saviour’s love for me!

For me it was in the garden
He prayed: “Not My will, but Thine”;
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweatdrops of blood for mine.

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calvary,
And suffered and died alone.

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
‘Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me.

Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine;
B7                     F#        B7
Living with Jesus, a new life divine;
E                      A          E7
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,
             A            B7          E
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

Chorus:

Moment by moment I’m kept in His love;
           C#m             F#        B7
Moment by moment I’ve life from above;
E                     C#         F#m
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
                          B7          E
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

Never a trial that He is not there,
Never a burden that He doth not bear;
Never a sorrow that He doth not share,
Moment by moment, I’m under His care.

Never a heartache and never a groan,
Never a teardrop and never a moan,
Never a danger, but there on the throne,
Moment by moment, He thinks of His own.

Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
Never a sickness that He cannot heal;
Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
Jesus, my Saviour, abides with me still.

Love was when God became a man
           A             A7         D           A7
Locked in time and space without rank or place;
D                       E
Love was God born of Jewish kin,
       A      A7            D           D7
Just a carpenter with some fishermen.
G              A                F#m B7
Love was when Jesus walked in history –
Em                  A       F#              Em A7
Lovingly He brought a new life that's free;
D                         E
Love was God nailed to bleed and die
    A         Em        A7     D
To reach and love one such as I.

Love was when God became a man
Down where I could see love that reached to me;
Love was God dying for my sin –
And so trapped was I, my whole world caved in.
Love was when Jesus rose to walk with me –
Lovingly He brought a new life that’s free;
Love was God – only He would try
To reach and love one such as I.
    Eb             D
To love one such as I.

A                                                 E7
I was sinking deep in sin, far from the peaceful shore,
                                                A
Very deeply stained within, sinking to rise no more;
                                                 D
But the Master of the sea heard my despairing cry,
                  A               E       A
From the waters lifted me, now safe am I.

Chorus:
A    E7 A                   D
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
                 A              B7        E
When nothing else could help, love lifted me;
A    E7 A                  D
Love lifted me! Love lifted me!
                 A                  E7 A
When nothing else could help, love lifted me.

All my heart to Him I give, ever to Him I’ll cling,
In His blessed presence live, ever His praises sing,
Love so mighty and so true merits my soul’s best songs;
Faithful, loving service, too, to Him belongs.

Souls in danger look above, Jesus completely saves;
He will lift you by His love, out of the angry waves.
He’s the Master of the sea, billows His will obey;
He your Savior wants to be – be saved today.

Wonderful love that rescued me, sunk deep in sin,
D                               D7          G
Guilty and vile as I could be – no hope within;
                                  C          Am
When ev’ry ray of light had fled, O glorious day!
D7                      G      Em G D7            G
Raising my soul from out the dead, love found a way.

Chorus:

Love found a way to redeem my soul,
                            Em D7 G
Love found a way that could make me whole;
                                   C
Love sent my Lord to the cross of shame,
             G G7 C              D7    G
Love found a way – O praise His holy name!

Love brought my Savior here to die on Calvary,
For such a sinful wretch as I – how can it be?
Love bridged the gulf ’twixt me and heav’n, taught me to pray;
I am redeemed, set free, forgiv’n – love found a way.

Love opened wide the gates of light to heav’n’s domain,
Where in eternal pow’r and might Jesus shall reign;
Love lifted me from depths of woe to endless day;
There was no help in earth below – love found a way.

Into the heart of Jesus Deeper and deeper I go,
A                     Em A D                 G       D
Seeking to know the rea-son Why he should love me so -

Why He should stoop to lift me Up from the miry clay,
            D A              D      G         A        D
Saving my soul, making me whole, Tho I had wandered away

Into the will of Jesus Deeper and deeper I go,
Praying for grace to follow, Seeking His way to know;
Bowing in full surrender Low at His blessed feet,
Bidding Him take, break me and make, Till I am molded and
meet.

Into the cross of Jesus Deeper and deeper I go,
Following thru the garden, Facing the dreaded foe;
Drinking the cup of sorrow – Sobbing with broken heart,
“O Saviour, help! dear Saviour, help! Grace for my weakness
impart.

Into the joy of Jesus Deeper and deeper I go,
Rising, with soul enraptured, Far from the world below;
Joy in the place of sorrow, Peace in the midst of pain,
Jesus will give, Jesus will give – He will uphold an sustain.

Into the love of Jesus Deeper and deeper I go,
Praising the One who bought me Out of my sin and woe;
And thru eternal ages Gratefully I shall sing,
“O how He loved ! O how He loved ! Jesus, my Lord and my
King !”

Fasting alone in the desert,
Tell of the days that are past,
How for our sins He was tempted,
Yet was triumphant at last.
Tell of the years of His labor,
Tell of the sorrow He bore,

He was despised and afflicted,
Homeless, rejected and poor.

Tell of the cross where they nailed Him,
Writhing in anguish and pain;
Tell of the grave where they laid Him,
Tell how He liveth again.
Love in that story so tender,
Clearer than ever I see:
Stay, let me weep while you whisper,
Love paid the ransom for me.

Scenes by the wayside, tales of the sea,
G7         Am D7 G7              C
Stories of Je-sus, tell them to me.

First let me hear how the children stood round His knee,
And I shall fancy His blessing resting on me;
Words full of kindness, deeds full of grace,
All in the lovelight of Jesus’ face.

Into the city I’d follow the children’s band,
Waving a branch of the palm tree high in my hand;
One of His heralds, yes, I would sing
Loudest hosannas, Jesus is King!

Its worthy praise fore-ver!

I love the name of Him whose heart
Knows all my griefs and bears a part;
Who bids all anxious fears depart-
I love the name of Jesus!

That name I fondly love to hear,
It never fails my heart to cheer;
Its music dries the falling tear,
Exalt the name of Jesus!

No word of man can ever tell
How sweet the name I love so well;
O let its praises ever swell,
O praise the name of Jesus!

Tell me the old, old story, of Jesus and His love.

Tell me the story slowly, that I may take it in-
That wonderful redemption, God’s remedy for sin.
Tell me the story often, for I forget so soon;
The early dew of morning has passed away at noon.

Tell me the story softly, with earnest tones and grave;
Remember, I’m the sinner whom Jesus came to save.
Tell me the story always, if you would really be,
In any time of trouble, a comforter to me.

Tell me the same old story when you have cause to fear
That this world’s empty glory is costing me too dear.
Yes, and when that world’s glory is dawning on my soul,
Tell me the old, old story-- Christ Jesus makes thee whole.

That angels brought down to earth;

They whispered it low, one night long ago,
               D      G G7
To a maiden of lowly birth.

That beautiful Name, That wonderful Name,
      G                  D G
That matchless Name is Jesus!

I know of a Name, a beautiful Name,
That unto a babe was given;
The stars glittered bright, throughout that glad night,
And angels praised God in heav'n.

The One of that Name, my Saviour became,
My Saviour of Calvary;
My sins nailed Him there, my burdens He bare,
He suffered all this for me.

I love that blest Name, That wonderful Name,
Made higher than all in heav'n;
'Twas whispered, I know, in my heart long ago-
To Jesus my life I've giv’n.

O, how I love Jesus -
    Am        D7        G
Because He first loved me!

It tells me of a Saviour’s love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood,
The sinner’s perfect plea.

It bids my trembling soul rejoice,
And dries each rising tear;
It tells me in a still small voice
To trust and never fear.

Jesus, the name I love so well,
The name I love to hear;
No saint on earth its worth can tell,
No heart conceive how dear.

This name shall be a comfort still
Along life’s thorny road,
Shall sweetly smooth the rugged hill
That leads me up to God.

And there, with all the blood-bought throng,
From sin and sorrow free,
I’ll sing the new eternal song
Of Jesus’ love to me.

It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
              D7      G               D7      G
And drives away his fear, and drives away his fear.

It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast;
‘Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary, rest. And to the weary, rest.

Dear name! the rock on which I build,
My shield and hiding place;
My never-failing treasure, filled
With boundless stores of grace! With boundless stores of grace!

Jesus, my Shepherd, Brother, Friend,
My Prophet, Priest and King,
My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
Accept the praise I bring, accept the praise I bring.

Oh, Jesus is the sweetest name I know.

There is no name in earth or heav’n above,
That we should give such bonor and such love,
As the blessed name, let us all acclaim,
That wondrous, glorious name of Jesus.

And some day I shall see Him face to face
To thank and praise Him for His wondrous grace,
Which He gave to me, when He made me free,
The blessed Son of God called Jesus.

Jesus! The name to sinners dear, the name to sinners giv'n;
    G                 C                G          D        G
It scatters all their guilty fear, it turns their hell to heav'n.

Jesus! the prisoner's fetters breaks, and bruises Satan's head;
Power into strengthless souls it speaks, and life into the dead.
O that the world might taste and see, the riches of His grace;
The arms of love that compass me, would all mankind embrace.

His only righteousness I show, his saving truth proclaim;
'Tis all my business here below to cry "Behold the Lamb!"
Happy, if with my latest breath I may but gasp His name,
Preach Him to all and cry in death, "Behold, behold the Lamb!"

If you from sin are longing to be free,

Look to the Lamb of God.

Are you a-weary, does the way seem long?
Look to the Lamb of God;
His love will cheer and fill your heart with song,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Fear not when shadows on your pathway fall,
Look to the Lamb of God;
In joy or sorrow Christ is all in all,
Look to the Lamb of God.

Love of Christ so freely given, Grace of God beyond degree,
Mercy higher than the heaven, Deeper than the deepest sea!

What a wonderful redemption! Never can a mortal know
How my sin, tho' red like crimson, Can be whiter than the snow.

Ev'ry need His hand supplying, Ev'ry good in Him I see;
On His strength divine relying, He is all in all to me.

By the crystal flowing river With the ransomed I will sing,
And forever and forever Praise and glorify the King.

This is the faith that keeps me still,
No matter what the test,
And lets me glory in His will-
For well I know tis’ best,
For well I know tis’ best.

So now the future holds no fear,
God guards the work begun;
And mortals are immortal here
Until their work is done,
Until their work is done.

Some day the path He chose for me
Will all be understood;
In heaven’s clearer light I’ll see
All things work’d out for good,
All things work’d out for good.

Lost in the darkness I stumbled alone,

Far from the sunlight of day;
A             D             A          D

Chilled in the shadows, I wandered in sin,
Far from the warmth of the light;
Then Jesus found me and changed me within,
Kindled His love in the night.

Now in the sunlight I follow His Word
Through every trial and test.
He is my Saviour and He is my Lord;
Gladly I give Him my best.

Praising my Saviour all the day long.

Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
Angels descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

Perfect submission, all is at rest,
I in my Saviour am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.

I've a peace that has come there to stay!

Constantly abiding, Jesus is mine;

Constantly abiding, rapture divine;

He never leaves me lonely, whispers, O so kind:
               C           G        C
"I will never leave thee," Jesus is mine.

All the world seemed to sing of a Saviour and King,
When peace sweetly came to my heart;
Troubles all fled away and my night turned to day,
Blessed Jesus, how glorious Thou art!

This treasure I have in a temple of clay,
While here on His footstool I roam:
But He's coming to take me some glorious day,
Over there to my heavenly home!

Cleansing without and within!

Chorus:

Why do I sing about Jesus?

Why is He precious to me?
         G7           C
He is my Lord and my Saviour;
G         D       G
Dying, He set me free!

Only a glimpse of His goodness;
That was sufficient for me.
Only one look at the Savior;
Then was my spirit set free.

He is the fairest of fair ones;
He is the Lily, the Rose;
Rivers of mercy surround Him,
Grace, love, and pity He shows.

Each step I take my Saviour goes before me,
             Em          A               D

To higher ground He ever leads me on;
           G                         D
Until someday the last step will be taken.
             Em         A               D
Each step I take just leads me closer Home.

At times I feel my faith begin to waver,
When up ahead I see a chasm wide.
And then I turn and look up to my Saviour,
I am strong when He is by my side.

I trust in God, no matter come what may,
For life eternal is in His hand,
He holds the key that opens up the way.
That will lead me to the promised land.

There is a calm, a sure retreat -
      G                C D G
‘Tis found beneath the mercy seat.

There is a place where Jesus sheds
The oil of gladness on our heads,
A place than all besides more sweet -
It is the blood bought mercy seat.

There is a scene where spirits blend,
Where friend holds fellowship with friend;
Tho sundered far, by faith they meet
Around one common mercy seat.

Ah! whither could we flee for aid
When tempted, desolate, dismayed,
Or how the hosts of hell defeat,
Had suff’ring saints no mercy seat?

Ah! there on eagle wings we soar,
And sin and sense molest no more;
And heav’n comes down our souls to greet,
While glory crowns the mercy seat.

How He came to bring deliverance To the captives in distress,
         D                            G         C        G
Take away our ev’ry burden, Giving perfect peace and rest.

                      C                 D                  G
I will follow all the way, Lord. I will follow Jesus ev’ry day.

O I love to walk with Jesus Like the man of long ago
Who had tarried by the wayside Near the gates of Jericho,
Jesus heard his cry for mercy, Gave him back his sight that day,
And immediately he followed Jesus all along the way.

O I love to walk with Jesus All the way to Calv’ry’s brow,
Gaze upon that scene of suffering While my tears of sorrow flow.
There He tells me how He loves me— Takes my ev’ry sin away;
So I follow Him so gladly, Lead me anywhere He may.

O sometime I’ll walk with Jesus In that land of endless day,
When our journey here is over And we’ve reached our home to
stay.
Then I’ll walk with him forever, Sing His praises o’er and o’er,
And with all the saints in glory Love, and worship, and adore.

Far away in the depths of my spirit tonight
                    A             D      D7
Rolls a melody sweeter than psalm;
      G            G7          C
In celestial-like strains it unceasingly falls
          G             D       G
O’er my soul like an infinite calm.

Coming down from the Father above,

Sweep over my spirit forever, I pray,
    G         D           G
In fathomless billows of love.

What a treasure I have in this wonderful peace
Buried deep in the heart of my soul,
So secure that no power can mine it away
While the years of eternity roll.

I am resting tonight in this wonderful peace,
Resting sweetly in Jesus’ control,
For I’m kept from all danger by night and by day,
And His glory is flooding my soul.

And me thinks when I rise to that city of peace
Where the Author of peace I shall see,
That one strain of the song which the ransomed will sing
In that heavenly kingdom will be:

Ah! Soul, are you here without comfort and rest,
Marching down the rough pathway of time?
Make Jesus your friend ere the shadows grow dark-
O accept of this peace so sublime!

554 (4/4 Dmaj)

There’s a new song in my heart.

All my sins are washed away,
        D7           G
In the blood of Calvary;

My hope is built on nothing less

                      B7
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
       A              E
But wholly lean on Jesus’ name.

Chorus:

On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
    E               B7
All other ground is sinking sand,
    E                B7       E
All other ground is sinking sand.

When darkness veils His lovely face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.

556 (6/8 Gmaj)

          G                          D
There comes to my heart one sweet strain,

A glad and a joyous refrain;
            G7       C
I sing it again and again-
          G         D           G
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.

Chorus:
                 C     G
Peace, peace, sweet peace!
A         A7           D D7
Wonderful gift from above!

Oh wonderful, wonderful peace!
       G           D7           G
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love!

Through Christ on the cross peace was made,
My debt by His death was all paid,
No other foundation is laid
For peace, the gift of God's love.

When Jesus as Lord I had crowned,
My heart with this peace did abound;
In Him the rich blessing I found-
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.

In Jesus for peace I abide,
And as I keep close to His side,
There's nothing but peace doth be-tide-
Sweet peace, the gift of God's love.

The spacious firmament on high,
      E           A D        E
With all the blue, ethereal sky,
      A          E         A D     E
And spangled heav'ns, a shining frame,
        E A D E              A
Their great original proclaim:
         E        A         E     A
The unwearied sun, from day to day,
 E     A      E      A         E
Does his Creator's pow'r display;
            A      E     A
And publishes to ev’ry land
E A           D    E7      A
The work of an almighty hand.

Soon as the evening shades prevail,
The moon takes up the wondrous tale;
And nightly, to the list’ning earth,
Repeats the story of her birth;
Whilst all the stars that round her burn,
And all the planets in their turn,
Confirm the tidings as they shine,
"The hand that made us is divine."

If rock and fire, though mindless, mute,
Of soul and spirit destitute,
Can their Creator’s praises sing
And tell the glories of their King,
Then I, so blest with gifts divine
Of heart and soul, of voice and mind,
Must far surpass the starry throng
In burning bright with heav’nly song!

While the dew is still on the roses,
         D7                    G
And the voice I hear, falling on my ear,
     A                D D7
The Son of God discloses.

Chorus:

And He walks with me, and He talks with me,
         D7               G
And He tells me I am His own;
                 B7        Em      C
And the joy we share as we tarry there,
      G        D7     G
None other has ever known.

He speaks, and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,
And the melody that He gave to me,
Within my heart is ringing.

When the road seems hard and long
And things keep on going wrong,

Someone always makes me strong,
His name is Jesus.
Sometimes on life’s restless waves,
I’m a ship without a sail,
But my Captain will never fail,
His name is Jesus.
The joy that he imparts
Brings a warmness to my heart
That’s far beyond compare
To the earthly joys I share.
While I walk and talk with Him,
All my battles He will win,
He helps me in everything,
His name is Jesus, His name is Jesus.

Friends around me, young and old,
Don’t be orphans in the cold,
Come to One who loves you so,
His name is Jesus.
Earthly treasures you possess
Won’t give deep down happiness,
Only One ever will do that,
His name is Jesus.
This modern world today
Soon can lead your heart astray,
There’s so much sin and strife
Creeping into every life.
Yet there’s one sure way you can
Overcome the Devil’s plan,
Put your faith and trust in One,
His name is Jesus, His name is Jesus.

How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
    G C           G              D       G
Is laid for your faith in His excellent Word!

What more can He say than to you He hath said,
     G C          G              D       G
To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?

Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed,
For I am thy God, I will still give thee aid;
I’ll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
Upheld by My gracious, omnipotent hand.

When through the deep waters I call thee to go,
The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow,
For I will be with thee, thy trials to bless,
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.

When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
My grace all-sufficient shall be thy supply;
The flames shall not hurt thee; I only design
Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.

The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,
I will not, I will not desert to his foes;
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
I’ll never , no never, no never forsake!

When I’m alone and I face the unknown,
And I fear what the future may be,
I can depend on the strength of my Friend –
He walks along with me.

Jesus is King, He controls everything;
He is with me each night and each day.
I trust my soul to the Saviour’s control;
He drives all fear away.

My soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly;

So sinful, so weary, Thine, Thine would I be;

Thou blest “Rock of Ages,” I’m hiding in Thee.

Chorus:

Hiding in Thee, Hiding in Thee,
             G       D         A          D
Thou blest “Rock of Ages,” I’m hiding in Thee.

In the calm of the noon-tide, in sorrow’s lone hour,
In times when temptation casts o’er me its pow’r;
In the tempests of life, on its wide, heaving sea,
Thou blest “Rock of Ages,” I’m hiding in Thee.

How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe,
I have fled to my Refuge and breathed out my woe;
How often, when trials like sea billows roll,
Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul.

His glory shall be seen,
    Dm G7              C
And He makes no mistake.

God sees my ways and counts my steps.
He hears my silent cry.
My heart is fixed; I trust in Him.
I need not ask Him why.

My faith and hope are in the Lord,
My refuge and high tow’r.
In quietness and confidence,
Shall be my strength this hour!

Jesus whispers sweet and low,

“Fear not, I am with thee, peace, be still,”
B7                         E
In all of life’s ebb and flow.

Chorus:

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus – sweetest name I know,
                A        B7                   E
Fills my ev’ry longing, keeps me singing as I go.

All my life was wrecked by sin and strife,
Discord filled my heart with pain;
Jesus swept across the broken strings,
Stirred the slumb’ring chords again.

Feasting on the riches of His grace,
Resting ‘neath His shelt’ring wing,
Always looking on His smiling face,
That is why I shout and sing.

Though sometimes He leads through waters deep,
Trials fall across the way,
Though sometimes the path seems rough and steep,
See His footprints all the way.

Soon He’s coming back to welcome me
Far beyond the starry sky;
I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown,
I shall reign with Him on high.

A table Thou hast prepared me
In presence of my foes;
My head with oil Thou hast ’nointed,
My cup it doth overflow;
Goodness and mercy shall follow,
Through all the days of my life;
And in God’s house will I dwell evermore.
In mansions fair will I dwell;
The Lord’s my wonderful Shepherd,
He gently leads me home.

That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought –
My sin, not in part, but the whole,
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll,
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend!
Even so – it is well with my soul!

D7       G                 D
On the way from earth to heaven,
         E                   A
“I will guide thee with Mine eye.”

Chorus:
        A                  D
I will guide thee, I will guide thee,
                               A
I will guide thee with Mine eye;

On the way from earth to heaven,
        D          A7          D
I will guide thee with Mine eye.

When temptations almost win thee,
And thy trusted watchers fly,
Let this promise ring within thee,
“I will guide thee with Mine eye.”

When thy secret hopes have perished
In the grave of years gone by,
Let this promise still be cherished,
“I will guide thee with Mine eye.”

When the shades of life are falling,
And the hour has come to die,
Hear the trusty Pilot calling,
“I will guide thee with Mine eye.”

I need Jesus, I need Him to the end;
No one like Him, He is the sinner’ s Friend;
I need Jesus, no other friend will do;
So constant, kind, so strong and true,
Yes, I need Jesus.

Rescued us from misery.
Thou Thy prodigals hast pardoned,
Loved us with a Father’s love;
Welcomed us with joy o’erflowing,
E’en to dwell with Thee above.

Clothed in garments of salvation,
At Thy table is our place;
We rejoice, and Thou rejoicest
In the riches of Thy grace.
“It is meet,” we hear Thee saying,
“We should merry be and glad,
I have found my once lost children,
Now they live, who once were dead.”

“Abba, Father!” all adore Thee,
All rejoice in heav’n above;
While in us they learn the wonders
Of Thy wisdom, grace and love.
Soon before Thy throne assembled,
All Thy children shall proclaim,
“Glory, everlasting glory,
Be to God and to the Lamb!”

The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,
He made them every one.

The tall trees in the greenwood,
The meadows where we play,
The rushes by the water,
To gather every day.

He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell
How great is God Almighty,
Who has made all things well.

When I humbly seek His face and bow the knee.

Praise the mount – I’m fixed upon it,
D          G D A           D
Mount of Thy redeeming love.

Here I raise mine Ebenezer – Hither by Thy help I’m come;
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure, Safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger, Wand’ring from the fold of
God;
He, to rescue me from danger, Bought me with his precious
blood.

O to grace how great a debtor Daily I’m constrained to be!
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter, Bind my wand’ring heart toThee:
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, Prone to leave the God I love;
Here’s my heart, O take and seal it, Seal it for Thy courts above.

Upon the chaos dark and rude,
And bid its angry tumult cease,
And give, for wild confusion, peace;
Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee,
For those in peril on the sea!

Our family shield in danger’s hour;
From rock and tempest, fire and foe,
Protect us wheresoe'er we go;
Thus evermore shall rise to Thee
Glad hymns of praise from land and sea.

All Thine own good pleasure
In Thy child fulfill.

Like a watered garden
Full of fragrance rare,
Ling’ring in Thy presence,

Since I found salvation from above
                           A
And I have such joy within,
                         E

I will fervently pray and His will obey,
         A             E          A
I will feast on His Word each day.

When my life is burdened down with care
And I am tempted to sin,
I continue with my Lord in prayer
And He gives new strength within.

I will hide God’s Word within my heart
And renew my mind each day.
From His Word I never shall depart
As I walk His narrow way.

From youth to age, by night and day,
In gladness and in woe.

Rejoice, give thanks and sing;
Your festal banner wave on high,
The cross of Christ your King.

Prophet swell the glad refrain,
And the white robed martyrs follow;
And, from morn to set of sun,
Through the Church the song goes on.

Holy Father, Holy Son,
Holy Spirit, Three we name Thee;
While in essence only One,
Undivided God we claim Thee,
And adoring bend the knee,
While we sing our praise to Thee.

Ten thousand times ten thousand sound
      C          D7      G
Thy praise; but who am I?

Thy brightness unto them appears;
Whilst I Thy footsteps trace.
A sound of God comes to my ears,
But they behold Thy face.
They sing because Thou art their Sun;
Lord, send a beam on me;
For where heaven is but once begun
There Hallelujahs be.

Enlighten with faith’s light my heart,
Inflame it with love’s fire;
Then shall I sing and bear a part
With that celestial choir.
I shall, I fear, be dark and cold,
With all my fire and light;
Yet when Thou dost accept their gold,
Lord, treasure up my mite.

How great a being, Lord, is Thine,
Which doth all beings keep!
Thy knowledge is the only line
To sound so vast a deep.
Thou art a sea without a shore,
A sun without a sphere;
Thy time is now and evermore,
Thy place is everywhere.

Chorus:

Give Him glory, all ye people,
                              A7      D
For His blood can wash away each stain.

Since the way is straight and narrow,
All I claimed was swept away;
My ambitions, plans and wishes,
At my feet in ashes lay.

Then God’s fire upon the altar
Of my heart was set aflame;
I shall never cease to praise Him,
Glory, glory to His name!

Blessed be the name of Jesus!
I’m so glad He took me in;
He’s forgiven my transgressions,
He has cleansed my heart from sin.

Glory, glory to the Father!
Glory, glory to the Son!
Glory, glory to the Spirit!
Glory to the Three in One!

       G          D                   A7      D
Sing “Holy, Holy, Holy,” to the great God Triune.

On thee, at the creation, the light first had its birth;
On thee, for our salvation, Christ rose from depths of earth;
On thee, our Lord, victorious, the Spirit sent from heav’n;
And thus on thee, most glorious, a triple light was giv’n.

Today on weary nations the heav’nly manna falls;
To holy convocations the silver trumpet calls,
Where gospel light is glowing with pure and radiant beams,
And living water flowing with soul-refreshing streams.

New graces ever gaining from this our day of rest,
We reach the rest remaining to spirits of the blest.
To Holy Ghost be praises, to Father, and to Son;
The Church her voice upraises to Thee, blest Three in one.

From everlasting Thou art God, to endless years the same.

Time, like an ever rolling stream, bears all its sons away;

Lord, how Thy wonders are displayed
Where’er I turn my eye:
If I survey the ground I tread,
Or gaze upon the sky.

There’s not a plant or flow’r below,
But makes Thy glories known;
And clouds arise and tempests blow,
By order from Thy throne;
While all that borrows life from Thee
Is ever in Thy care,
And ev’rywhere that man can be,
Thou, God, art present there.

Happy day, happy day, when Jesus washed my sins away!

O happy bond, that seals my vows
To Him who merits all my love!
Let cheerful anthems fill His house,
While to that sacred place I move.

‘Tis done, the great transaction’s done!
I am my Lord’s, and He is mine;
He drew me, and I followed on,
Charmed to confess the voice divine.

Now rest, my long divided heart;
Fixed on this blissful center, rest;
Nor ever from my Lord depart,
With Him of ev’ry good possessed.

How wonderful, how intricate, what great complexity

Is found within each small detail of my a-na-to-my!

Each part of me performs its role as was ordained by Thee:
Each single cell was made to dwell and work in harmony.
They all together make the whole: a massive company,
Complete to keep the Life within - what grand technology!

I've yet to fully understand the workings of my mind:
How great and mighty thoughts can be within a space confined!
My soul can feel, can hope, can trust, and can express to Thee
The raging tides I feel inside, of love and loyalty.

How excellently made am I, how blessed in every part!
Yet greater still than these is that Thou livest in my heart!
Without Thy presence in my soul, my life pulsates in vain
But Thou hast cleansed and made me whole and all Thyself,
contain!

Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth,
Shelters thee under His wings, yea, so gently sustaineth!
Hast thou not seen how thy desires e'er have been
Granted in what He ordaineth?

Praise to the Lord, who with marvelous wisdom hath made thee!
Decked thee with health, and with loving hand guided and stayed
thee;
How oft in grief hath not He brought thee relief,
Spreading His wings for to shade thee!

Praise to the Lord! O let all that is in me adore Him!
All that has life and breath, come now with praises before Him!
Let the Amen sound from His people again:
Gladly for aye we adore Him.

When you met with great temptation,
Did you think to pray?
By His dying love and merit
Did you claim the holy Spirit
As your guide and stay?

When your heart was filled with anger,
Did you think to pray?
Did you plead for grace, my brother,
That you might forgive another
Who has crossed your way?

When sore trials came upon you,
Did you think to pray?
When your soul was bowed in sorrows,
Balm of Gilead did you borrow
At the gates of day?

And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, Sweet hour of prayer,
May I thy consolation share,
Till, from Mount Pisgah’s lofty height,
I view my home and take my flight.
This robe of flesh I’ll drop and rise
To seize the everlasting prize;
And shout, while passing through the air,
Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer.

Men lost and dying, souls in despair;
O give me power, power in prayer!

My weakened will, Lord, Thou canst renew;
My sinful nature Thou canst subdue;
Fill me just now with power anew,
Power to pray and power to do!

Teach me to pray, Lord, teach me to pray;
Thou art my pattern, day unto day;
Thou art my surety, now and for aye;
Teach me to pray, Lord, teach me to pray.

Joy of salvation and of praise,
To us impart!

Help us carry our daily cross,
Bear up our burden with good cheer,
Be they so weary and so drear,
Mind not the loss!

We thank Thee for strength of each hour,
For health and wealth, for home and friends,
For peace and quiet confidence,
Our shield and tower!

We pray for church at home, abroad.
We pray for gov’nors of our land,
We pray for missions to earth’s end,
Send forth Thy Word!

O Father, bless us when we part.
Thy Spirit pour down from on high.
Till Thy servants again draw nigh,
Breathe in our hearts!

The hour of prayer?

Then is my strength by Thee renewed;
Then are my sins by Thee forgiv’n;
Then dost Thou cheer my solitude
With hope of heav’n.

No words can tell what sweet relief
There for my ev’ry want I find.
What strength for warfare, balm for grief,
What peace of mind!

Hushed is each doubt, gone ev’ry fear;
My spirit seems in heav’n to stay:
And e’en the penitential tear
Is wiped away.

Lord, till I reach yon blissful shore,
No privilege so dear shall be
As thus my inmost soul to pour
In prayer to Thee.

He lived and died to buy my pardon,

And life is worth the living just because He lives.

How sweet to hold a newborn baby,
And feel the pride and joy he gives.
But greater still the calm assurance,
This child can face uncertain days because He lives.

The Son of God, He paid my ransom;
Went to the cross, My sins to bear.
No greater love! His life He laid down:
He died for me and thus for ever set me free.

Now I serve Him, My Living Saviour;
I walk with Him, from day to day.
He leads me on the heavenly pathway;
I know He keeps me in the shadow of His wings.

And then one day I'll cross the river,
I'll fight life's final war with pain.
And then as death gives way to victory,
I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives.

    G        D7      G
He lives within my heart.

In all the world around me I see His loving care,
And though my heart grows weary I never will despair.
I know that He is leading, through all the stormy blast;
The day of His appearing will come at last.

Rejoice, rejoice, O Christian! Lift up your voice and sing
Eternal hallelujahs to Jesus Christ, the King!
The hope of all who seek Him, the help of all who find,
None other is so loving, so good and kind.

Caught up to meet Him in the skies;
When shall these glories meet our eyes?

Faithful and true would He find us here
If He should come today?
Watching in gladness and not in fear,
If He should come today?
Signs of His coming multiply,
Morning light breaks in eastern sky;
Watch, for the time is drawing nigh-
What if it were today?

Waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?

If at the dawn of the early morning

Will He answer thee, "Well done"?

Have we been true to the trust He left us?
Do we seek to do our best?
If in our hearts there is naught condemns us,
We shall have a glorious rest.

Blessed are those whom the Lord finds watching,
In His glory they shall share;
If He shall come at the dawn or midnight,
Will He find us watching there?

O Lord Jesus, how long, how long

Christ returneth! Hallelujah!
G     C     G C         G       C
Hallelujah! Amen, Hallelujah! Amen.

It may be at midday, it may be at twilight,
It may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight
Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,
When Jesus receives His own.

While hosts cry Hosanna, from heaven descending,
With glorified saints and the angels attending,
With grace on His brow, like a halo of glory,
Will Jesus receive His own.

O joy! O delight! Should we go without dying,
No sickness, no sadness, no dread and no crying,
Caught up thru the clouds with our Lord into glory,
When Jesus receives His own.

What a gathering, what a gathering
       C                       G7 C
Of the ransomed in that happy home above!

When the blest who sleep in Jesus at His bidding shall arise,
From the silence of the grave and from the sea,
And with bodies all celestial they shall meet Him in the skies,
What a gathering and rejoicing there will be!

When our eyes behold the city with its many mansions bright
And its river, calm and restful, flowing free,
When the friends that death hath parted shall in bliss again unite,
What a gathering and a greeting there will be!

O the King is surely coming and the time is drawing nigh
When the blessed day of promise we shall see,
Then the changing “in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,”
And forever in His presence we shall be.

Bright gems for His crown.

He will gather, He will gather,
The gems for His kingdom,
All the pure ones, all the bright ones,
His loved and His own.

Little children, little children,
Who love their Redeemer.
Are the jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and His own.

When the roll is called up yonder I’ll be there!

On that bright and cloudless morning
When the dead in Christ shall rise
And the glory of His resurrection share
When his chosen ones shall gather
To their home beyond the skies,
And the roll is called up yonder I’ll be there!

Let us labour for the Master
From the dawn till setting sun,
Let us talk of all His wondrous love and care;
Then when all of life is over
And our work on earth is done,
And the roll is called up yonder I’ll be there!

One glimpse of His dear face all sorrow will erase,
                    G                      C
So bravely run the race till we see Christ.

Sometimes the sky looks dark with not a ray of light,
We’re tossed and driven on, no human help in sight;
But there is One in heav’n who knows our deepest care,
Let Jesus solve your problem - just go to Him in prayer.

Life’s day will soon be o’er, all storms forever past,
We’ll cross the great divide to glory, safe at last;
We’ll share the joys of heav’n – a harp, a home, a crown,
The tempter will be banished, we’ll lay our burdens down.

Lift up your head, redemption draweth nigh.

Wars and strife on every hand,
And violence fills our land,
Still many people doubt He’ll come again;
But the Word of God is true,
He’ll redeem His chosen few,
Don’t lose hope, soon Christ Jesus will descend.

He’ll shout the victory, break through the blue,
                G          D7         G
Some golden daybreak, for me, for you.

Sad hearts will gladden, all shall be bright,
Goodbye forever to earth’s dark night;
Changed in a moment, like Him to be,
Oh, glorious daybreak, Jesus I’ll see.

Oh, what a meeting, there in the skies,
No tears nor crying shall dim our eyes;
Loved ones united eternally,
Oh, what a daybreak that morn will be.

Descend the clouds – O glorious day!

I think of Him – ‘twas first He thought about me,
And chose me by His grace so rich and free;
He gave to me a garment pure and spotless,
And wrote my name in heaven’s Book of Life!

He bids me walk in pathways strait and narrow,
And shun the gate so wide, and broad the way;
For me He has prepared a place in heaven;
Someday He’ll come to take me home on high!

“O weary soul, let not your heart be troubled;
Believe in God, believe also in Me!”
When Christ shall come, believers shall be transformed;
We’ll be like Him – O glorious, glorious day!

Redeemed from all our sin and strife,
There we’ll know perfect love, endless life.

One day when heaven was filled with His praises,

Buried, He carried my sins far away;

Rising, He justified freely forever:
F              D               G     C
One day He’s coming – oh, glorious day!

One day they led Him up Calvary’s mountain,
One day they nailed Him to die on the tree;
Suffering anguish, despised and rejected,
Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He!

One day they left Him alone in the garden,
One day He rested, from suffering free;
Angels came down o’er His tomb to keep vigil;
Hope of the hopeless, my Saviour is He!

One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,
One day the stone rolled away from the door;
Then He arose, over death He has conquered,
Now is ascended, my Lord evermore!

One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,
One day the skies with His glory will shine;
Wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing;
Glorious Saviour, this Jesus is mine!

Crowns at His feet we will cast:

Sometimes cooking Hokkien mee.

The more that I love Him, more love He bestows;

Each day is like heaven, my heart overflows

The longer I serve Him, the sweeter He grows.

Every need He is supplying,
Plenteous grace He bestows;
Every day my way gets brighter
The longer I serve Him the sweeter He grows.

Like a little candle burning in the night;

In this world of darkness we must shine,

You in your small corner, and I in mine.

Jesus bids us shine, first of all for Him;
Well He sees and knows it if our light is dim;
He looks down from heaven, sees us shine,
You in your small corner, and I in mine.

Jesus bids us shine, then, for all around
Many kinds of darkness in this world abound.
Sin and want and sorrow: we must shine,
You in your small corner and I in mine.

Jesus bids us shine, as we work for Him,
Bringing those that wander from the paths of sin;
He will ever help us, if we shine,
You in your small corner and I in mine.

I am a stranger here within a foreign land,

My home is far away upon a golden strand;
                 D7               G
Ambassador to be of realms beyond the sea,
             D        A       D
I’m here on business for my King.

This is the message that I bring,
             A       E           A
A message angels fain would sing;
            D
“Oh, be ye reconciled,”
               G
Thus saith my Lord and King,
            D    A7       D
“Oh, be ye reconciled to God.”

This is the King’s command, that all men everywhere
Repent and turn away from sin’s seductive snare;
That all who will obey with Him shall reign for aye,
And that’s my business for my King.

My home is brighter far than Sharon’s rosy plain,
Eternal life and joy throughout its vast domain;
My Sovereign bids me tell how mortals there may dwell,
And that’s my business for my King.

Work, for the night is coming, when man’s work is done.

Work, for the night is coming, work through the sunny noon;
Fill brightest hours with labour, rest comes sure and soon.
Give every flying minute something to keep in store;
Work, for the night is coming, when man works no more.

Work, for the night is coming, under the sunset skies;
While their bright tints are glowing, work, for daylight flies.
Work till the last beam fadeth, fadeth to shine no more;
Work, while the night is darkening, when man’s work is over.

Tell how He helps you live;
Tell of the strength and comfort
Which He will freely give!

Speak just a word for Jesus,
Do not for others wait;
Gladly proclaim the message
Soon it willl be too late!

Speak just a word for Jesus,
Why should you doubt or fear?
Surely His love will bless it;
Someone will gladly hear.

Speak just a word for Jesus,
Tell of His love for men!
Someone distressed may listen,
Willing to trust Him then.

Let us hope, let us watch, and labour till the master comes.

To the work! To the work! Let the hungry be fed,
To the fountain of life let the weary be led;
In the cross and its banner our glory shall be,
While we herald the tidings, Salvation is free!

To the work! To the work! There is labor for all,
For the kingdom of darkness and error shall fall;
And the name of Jehovah exalted shall be
In the loud swelling chorus, Salvation is free!

To the work! To the work! In the strength of the Lord,
And a robe and a crown shall our labor reward
When the home of the faithful our dwelling shall be
And we shout with the ransomed, Salvation is free!

My life possessing, my service blessing,

Make me a channel of blessing today.

Is your life a channel of blessing?
Are you burdened for those who are lost?
Have you urged upon those who are straying
The Saviour who died on the cross?

Is your life a channel of blessing?
Is it daily telling for Him?
Have you spoken the word of salvation
To those who are dying in sin?

We cannot be channels of blessing
If we consciously trifle with sin;
We will barriers be and a hindrance
To those we are trying to win.

Love as the Master loved you;
Be to the helpless a helper indeed,
Unto your mission be true.

There is joy in serving Jesus, joy amid the darkest night,
For I’ve learned the wondrous secret, and I’m walking in the light.

When upon life’s billows you are tempest tossed,
                                      D
When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,
                                          A
Count your many blessings, name them one by one,
                                             D
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.

Chorus:
                                 A
Count your blessings, name them one by one,
                               D
Count your blessings, see what God hath done!
           G           A
Count your blessings, name them one by one,
D                G                  A         D
Count your many blessings see what God hath done.

Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly,
And you will be singing as the days go by.

When you look at others with their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold;
Count your many blessings. money cannot buy
Your reward in heaven, nor your home on high.

So, amid the conflict whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged, God is over all;
Count your many blessings, angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you to your journey’s end.

He only is the Maker
Of all things near or far;
He paints the wayside flower;
He lights the ev’ning star;
The winds and winds obey Him;
By Him the birds are fed;
Much more to us, His children,
He gives our daily bread.

We thank Thee then, O Father,
For all things bright and good,
The seed time and the harvest,
Our life, our health, our food.
No gift have we to offer
For all Thy love imparts,
But that which Thou desirest
Our humble, thankful hearts.

Since Jesus came into my heart.

I have ceased from my wand’ring and going astray,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And my sins, which were many, are all washed away,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

I possessed of a hope that is steadfast and sure
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure
Since Jesus came into my heart!

There’s a light in the valley of death now for me,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And the gates of the City beyond I can see,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

I shall go there to dwell in that City, I know,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And I’m happy, so happy, as onward I go,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

Thank you, Lord, for saving my soul,

Thank you, Lord, for giving to me
              C        D7       G
Thy great salvation so rich and free.

Some thank Him for the flow’rs that grow,
Some for the stars that shine;
My heart is filled with joy and praise
Because I know He’s mine.

I trust in Him from day to day,
I prove His saving grace;
I’ll sing this song of praise to Him
Until I see His face.

Which reaches far and near.

Thank You for free and full salvation,

Chorus:
              C                 D
But it goes against the way I am,

To put my human nature down
            Am             D7            G G7
And let the Spirit take control of all I do;
                      C
'Cause when those trials come,
    D              Bm                     Em
My human nature shouts the thing to do,
                 Am                 D7        G
And God's soft prompting can be easily ignored.

But I thank You, Lord, with each trial I feel inside,
That you're there to help, lead and guide my way from wrong;
'Cause You’ve promised, Lord, that with every testing,
That your way of escaping, is easier to bear.

Yes, I thank You, Lord, For the vict’ry that growing brings
In surrender of everything, life is so worthwhile;
*And I thank You, Lord, that when everything's put in place,
*Out in front I can see your face and it's there You belong.

My soul in mercy to reclaim

Through grace He lifted me.

Chorus:
      G               D7
From sinking sand He lifted me;
                     G
With tender hand He lifted me;

From shades of night to plains of light,
   G                   D7 G
O praise His name, He lifted me!

He called me long before I heard,
Before my sinful heart was stirred;
But when I took Him at His word,
Forgiven He lifted me.

His brow was pierced with many a thorn,
His hands by cruel nails were torn,
When from my guilt and grief, forlorn,
In love He lifted me.

Now on a higher plane I dwell,
And with my soul I know ‘tis well;
Yet how or why, I cannot tell,
He should have lifted me.

O what a wonderful, wonderful day –
                     A
Day I will never forget;
A7
After I’d wandered in darkness away,
                     D
Jesus my savior, I met.

O what a tender, compassionate friend –
D7                      G
He met the need of my heart;
                          D
Shadows dispelling, with joy I am telling,
    A                          D
He made all the darkness depart.

Chorus:

Heaven came down and glory filled my soul,
D            Bm       Em      A        D    G D
When at the cross the Savior made me whole;
   Em                  G            D       F#       Bm A
My sins were washed away, and my night was turned to day –
D              Bm       Em A          D G D
Heaven came down and glory filled my soul.

Born of the Spirit with life from above
Into God’s family divine,
Justified fully through Calvary’s love,
O what a standing is mine!
And the transaction so quickly was made,
When as a sinner I came,
Took of the offer of grace He did proffer –
He saved me, O praise His dear name!

Now I’ve a hope that will surely endure
After the passing of time;
I have a future in Heaven for sure,
There in those mansions sublime.
And it’s because of that wonderful day,
When at the cross I believed;
Riches eternal and blessings supernal
From his precious hand I received.

For He is so precious to me.

He stood at my heart’s door ‘mid sunshine and rain,
And patiently waited an entrance to gain;
What shame that so long He entreated in vain,
For He is so precious to me.

I stand on the mountain of blessing at last,
No cloud in the heavens a shadow to cast;
His smile is upon me, the valley is past,
For He is so precious to me.

I praise Him because He appointed a place
Where some day, through faith in His wonderful grace,
I know I shall see Him – shall look on His face,
For He is so precious to me.

While I live by faith and do His blessed will;

Then sweeping up to glory I’ll see His blessed face,
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll; Hallelujah!

He will guide my steps aright thru the vale and o’er the height –
D7 G                          C
It is glory just to walk with Him.

It is glory when the shadows fall to know that He is near,
O what joy to simply trust and pray!
It is glory to abide in Him when skies above are clear –
Yes, with Him it’s glory all the way!

‘Twill be glory when I walk with Him on heaven’s golden shore,
Never from His side again to stray;
‘Twill be glory, wondrous glory with the Savior evermore –
Everlasting glory all the way!

I have a song that Jesus gave me,

It was sent from heav’n above;

I love the Christ who died on Calv’ry,
For He washed my sins away;

With the angels I will sing;
’Twill be a song with glorious harmony,
When the courts of heaven ring.

I’ve found a Friend, Oh, such a Friend!
     D7              G
He loved me ere I knew Him;
                       C
He drew me with the cords of love,
       G       D7           G
And thus He bound me to Him.
       D7                 G
And round my heart still closely twine
         C         A7          D
Those ties which naught can sever,
    G              C
For I am His, and He is mine,
    G      D7     G
Forever and forever.

I’ve found a Friend, Oh, such a Friend!
He bled, He died to save me;
And not alone the gift of life,
But His own self He gave me.
Naught that I have my own I call,
I hold it for the Giver;
My heart, my strength, my life, my all,
Are His, and His forever.

I’ve found a Friend, Oh, such a Friend!
All pow’r to him is given,
To guard me on my onward course,
And bring me safe to heaven.
The eternal glories gleam afar,
To nerve my faint endeavor;
So now to watch, to work, to war,
And then to rest forever.

I’ve found a Friend, Oh, such a Friend!
So kind, and true and tender,
So wise a Counsellor and Guide,
So mighty a Defender!
From Him who loves me now so well,
What pow’r my soul can sever?
Shall life or death, or earth or hell?
No; I am His forever.

I’m singing for my Lord everywhere I go,
A                E           F#m                 B7
Singing of His wondrous love that the world may know,
E                               A
How He saved a wretch like me by His death at Calvary,
      E                F#m B7        E
I’m singing for my Lord everywhere I go.

I’m singing, but sometimes heavy is the load,
For this world is not a friend to the grace of God.
Yet I sing the whole day long for He fills my heart with song,
I’m singing for my Lord everywhere I go.

I’m singing for the lost just because I know,
Jesus Christ, whose precious blood washes white as snow.
If my songs to Him can bring some lost souls I’ll gladly sing,
I’m singing for my Lord everywhere I go.

I’m singing for the saints as they journey home,
Soon they’ll reach that happy land where they’ll never roam,
And with me they’ll join and sing praises to our Lord and King,
I’m singing for my Lord everywhere I go.

750 (9/8 - 12/8 Emaj)

On the cruel cross He suffered,

From the curse to set me free.

Chorus: (12/8)
E7       A             E
Sing, O sing, of my Redeemer!
          B7                 E E7
With His blood He purchased me,
         A                E
On the cross He sealed my pardon,
         B7                 E
Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave.

I will praise my Redeemer,
His triumphant pow’r I’ll tell,
How the victory He giveth
Over sin and death and hell.

I will sing of my Redeemer,
And His heav’nly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God with Him to be.

751 (4/4 Emaj)

E                                      B7
Life has purpose now it never had before.
                                           E
There is meaning to each day and even more;
                                        A
For a joy and peace I can’t explain is mine,
          E                B7               E
Since I found new life in Christ, my Lord divine.

Chorus:
                          F#m
O it is wonderful to be a Christian;
        B7                      E
O it is wonderful to be God’s child!
                                       A
O it is wonderful to have your sins forgiven;
         E           B7
O it is wonderful to be redeemed,
E             B7         E
Justified, forever reconciled!

I can go directly to the Lord in prayer,
He has told me I may boldly enter there,
And He listens as His promises I plead.
I find mercy there and grace for every need.

And the hope of heaven’s glories thrills me so,
Where I’ll live with Christ forevermore, I know;
That is why the things of earth I loosely hold.
I’ve eternal riches, better far than gold.

752 (3/4 - 4/4 Gmaj)

    G                                D
I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,
                                D7      G
Confused at the grace that so fully He proffers me;
                                      D
I tremble to know that for me He was crucified –
      A                    A7           D
That for me, a sinner, He suffered, He bled, and died.

Chorus:
G                                   D7
O it is wonderful – That He should care for me
            G
Enough to die for me!
G       Am          D7           G
O it is wonderful – Wonderful to me!

I marvel that He would descend from His throne divine
To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine;
That He should extend His great love unto such as I –
Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.

I think of His hands pierced and bleeding to pay the debt!
Such mercy, such love and devotion can I forget?
No, no! I will praise and adore at the mercy-seat,
Until at the glorified throne I kneel at His feet.

                                         A             D
How He left His home in glory for the cross of Calvary.

A          D                                A                  D
Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story of the Christ who died for me,
 A       D                                 A               D
Sing it with the saints in glory, gathered by the crystal sea.

I was lost but Jesus found me – found the sheep that went astray,
Threw His loving arms around me, drew me back into His way.

I was bruised but Jesus healed me – faint was I from many a fall;
Sight was gone and fears possessed me, but He freed me from
them all.

Days of darkness still come o'er me, sorrow's paths I often tread;
But the Saviour still is with me – by His hand I'm safely led.

He will keep me till the river rolls its waters at my feet;
Then He'll bear me safely over, where the loved ones I shall
meet.

A new life God gave to me,
New life abundant and free;

Until I look on His face.

With the two Thessalonians right behind.

Now only seven more remain.

You’ve got First and Second Peter, then First John,
But John has three books before you go on,
Now we’re almost done – there’s only Jude
And Revelation, now our song is due.

The Bible stands like a rock undaunted

’Mid the raging storms of time;

The Bible stands like a mountain tow’ring
Far above the works of men;
Its truth by none ever was refuted,
And destroy it they never can.

The Bible stands, and it will forever
When the world has passed away;
By inspiration it has been given-
All its precepts I will obey.

The Bible stands every test we give it
For its Author is divine;
By grace alone I expect to live it
And to prove it and to make it mine.

Thy Word is like an armory where soldiers may repair
And find, for life’s long battleday, all needful weapons there.

O may I love Thy precious Word, may I explore the mine,
May I its fragrant flowers glean, may light upon me shine.
O may I find my armor there, Thy Word my trusty sword!
I’ll learn to fight with every foe the battle of the Lord!

Love for Thy Word, O Lord, love for Thy Word,

Thine own dear breath, O Lord, within Thy Word!

Fill me with zeal to find in each and every line
Bm         Em             Am         D7 G
Riches of truth so fine: gems from Thy Word!

Love for Thy Word, O Lord, love for Thy Word,

Let all Thy glory shine forth, from Thy Book Divine
Into this heart of mine, life from Thy Word!

Make my soul cleave, O Lord, unto Thy Word;
Give to my heart this day this blessedness, I pray
Both to hear and obey all of Thy Word!

’Mid the storms of doubt and unbelief we fear,
                 Am             D7           G
Stands a Book eternal that the world holds dear;
             C                              Am
Through the restless ages it remains the same-
           G                  D             G    G7
’Tis the Book of God, and the Bible is its name!

Chorus:
     C G7               C                        G7      C
The old Book and the old Faith are the Rock on which I stand!
      C G7              C               G       D      G G7
The old Book and the old Faith are the bulwark of the land!
            C                    Am
Through storm and stress they stand the test,
   D               G
In ev’ry clime and nation blest;
     C D7              Am F             C      G7      C
The old Book and the old Faith, are the hope of ev’ry land!

’Tis the Book that tells us of the Father’s love,
When He sent His Son to us from heav’n above,
Who by richest promise creates hope within,
For ’tis through His blood we are saved from every sin!

’Tis the Book that tells us of the will of God
And the Saviour’s teachings while the earth He trod-
How He soothed earth’s sorrows and relieved its woe,
Through whom strength is given to conquer every foe!

’Tis the Book that tells us of eternal life,
After faithful service in a world of strife,
And this glorious triumph over death’s dark fears
Is the world’s best gift in an age of countless tears!

Grand chorus at close (May be omitted)
        C                      F      Dm
O the grand old Book and the dear old Faith
        C         G7      C
Are the Rock on which I stand!
         C                     F      Dm
O the grand old Book and the dear old Faith
         G             C
Are the hope of ev’ry land!

    G               G7            C       G
I have a precious Book, it's the Word of God,
         D              D7       G
It's the only Book that God has giv'n.
                           G7          C           Am
As I read, God speaks to me- I see Christ and Calvary,
       G         D        G
The wonderful Word of God.

Forever it will stand as the ages roll,
It's the living and eternal Word.
It's my guiding light each day and without it I would stray;
The Wonderful Word of God.

Dear Lord, may I each day read Thy precious Word,
May I love it and obey it too.
May I grow to be like Thee, may my friends see Christ in me-
In Jesus' Name, Amen.

Open my eyes, that I may see
Am           D7           G
Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;
B7          Em           B7      Em
Place in my hands the wonderful key
A                         A7   D
That shall unclasp and set me free.

Silently now I wait for Thee,

Ready my God, Thy will to see;

Open my eyes -- illumine me, Spirit divine!

Open my ears, that I may hear
Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;
And while the wave notes fall on my ear,
Ev’rything false will disappear.
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
Open my ears -- illumine me, Spirit divine!

Open my mouth, and let me bear
Gladly the warm truth ev’rywhere;
Open my heart and let me prepare
Love with Thy children thus to share.
Silently now I wait for Thee,
Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
Open my heart -- illumine me, Spirit divine!
